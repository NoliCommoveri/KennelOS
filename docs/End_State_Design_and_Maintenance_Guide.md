# KennelOS — End-State Design & Maintenance Guide

> ## ⚠️ REFERENCE ONLY in this repo — not the current-state map

> This guide describes the **pre-editions, single-app KennelOS**. In *this* repo that
> whole app has been relocated under **`shared/`** (and is being split into
> `shared/` + `pro/`). So this document is now **reference material for the shared/Pro
> code**, not the authoritative description of the repo as a whole.
>
> - **Authoritative current-state architecture** = the editions model: the top-level
>   `README.md` (layout + build status) plus `docs/KennelOS_Lite_Pro_Editions_Plan.md`
>   and `docs/KennelOS_Lite_Cap_Enforcement_Spec.md`.
> - **Path translation:** wherever this guide says `KennelOS/…` or a bare `data/…`,
>   `assets/…`, `pages/…`, `sw.js`, read it as **`shared/…`** (e.g. `shared/data/db.js`,
>   `shared/sw.js`). The single service worker described in §12 is now the *shared
>   default*; each edition will get its own `sw.js` + cache name.
> - **Still true and still load-bearing:** everything about the data model, the Dexie
>   schema, the repo layer, referential integrity, the Event model, escaping contracts,
>   and the change recipes — that all applies unchanged to the code now under `shared/`.
>   The `data/editionConfig.js` injection point (Lite/Pro cap hooks) is the one addition
>   not yet folded into the sections below.
>
> Treat everything under this line as an accurate map of the shared/Pro **code**, with
> the caveats above.

The single current-state reference for the KennelOS dog-breeding records app. It
describes what the app **is today** and how to change it safely: architecture, data
model, module map, invariants, and the common "how do I change X" recipes. Read it
first.

Where a field-level or rule-level detail matters, the **code is authoritative** — where a
doc and the code disagree, the code wins and the doc is what gets fixed.

---

## 1. What the app is

A **local-first, static, multi-page web app** for managing a dog-breeding program:
dogs and pedigrees, contacts, kennels, pairings and litters (including **foster-in /
foster-out** litters, §25), sales/placements, stud services, contracts, a polymorphic
health/history event log, an expense/income ledger, reminders, a dashboard, analytics
reports, CSV/JSON import-export, and a read-only Companion share-out for buyers and
partners.

- **No backend, no build step.** Plain ES modules served over HTTP. Hosted on GitHub
  Pages; all data lives in the browser (IndexedDB via Dexie).
- **Single user, single device** is the design centre. Data moves between devices only
  through explicit JSON backup/restore or CSV import/export.
- **Offline-capable PWA.** A service worker precaches the app shell so it works offline
  after the first load.

---

## 2. Architecture non-negotiables

These are load-bearing. Changing any of them is a design decision, not a routine edit.

1. **Multi-page static, no SPA router.** One `.html` per screen, each pulling in shared
   JS. Navigation is real links between pages.
2. **Strict layering: pages → repos → Dexie.** Pages never import `db.js` and never
   call `db.*`. Only the repo modules in `data/` touch Dexie.
3. **ES modules over HTTP.** Must be served (`python3 -m http.server`, `npx serve`, or
   GitHub Pages) — never opened as `file://`, which CORS-blocks module imports.
4. **No CDN / no network deps.** Everything third-party is vendored under
   `KennelOS/vendor/` and loaded by relative path (Dexie, PapaParse, lz-string). The
   app must work fully offline after first load. The one deliberate exception is the
   **Dropbox sync feature set** (§26): those buttons talk to the Dropbox HTTP API with
   plain `fetch` (still no vendored/CDN code) and are online-only by design — every
   other part of the app keeps working offline.
5. **One thin repo per entity**, uniform surface (see §6). New entity = new repo + new
   page; you don't reshape existing ones.

## 4. Data model

### 4.1 Entities and their required fields

Every record also carries `id` (UUID), `is_archived` (bool), `created_at`,
`updated_at`. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings except `created_at`/`updated_at` (full
ISO). Required = enforced in the repo's validator; everything else is optional and
commonly blank at entry time.

| Entity | Required | Notable other fields |
|---|---|---|
| **Dog** | `call_name`, `sex`, `breed`, `ownership_type`, `status` | `registered_name`, `date_of_birth`, `date_of_death`, `sire_id`, `dam_id`, `litter_id`, `breeder_kennel_id` (the kennel that *produced* this dog — own or an outside contact's; distinct from `kennel_id`, the kennel it belongs to *now* — the user's own for a dog they own, or an outside kennel for an external/leased dog (the form's Kennel picker offers every kennel, not just own ones); auto-prefilled from the litter's dam's own `kennel_id` when that dam is owned/co-owned), `owner_contact_id`, `co_owner_contact_ids[]`, `kennel_id`, `color_markings`, `registry`, `registration_number`, `microchip_id`, `url` (plain, unindexed — a link for this dog, e.g. a registry page or listing), `planned_tests[]`, `recorded_coi{value,method,source,as_of_date}`, `disposition` (`undecided`/`keeping`/`available`/`placed` — breeder intent; **puppy-only**, valid only while `status='puppy'` and forced null otherwise. Enforced in `dogRepo` create/update and mirrored in the UI: the dog form shows it only for a puppy, `sale.js` won't set one on a non-puppy, the profile hides the row otherwise. Feeds the Today "Active litters" card, the promote-lifecycle nudge, and the litter-lifecycle nudges, §19), `notes`. Owner required when `ownership_type ∈ {external, leased_in}`. |
| **Contact** | `name` | `contact_type[]` (multi), `email`, `phone`, `address`, `kennel_id`, `waitlist_status`, `first_contact_source`, `notes`, `companion_note` (plain, unindexed — a per-recipient message **meant for the recipient's eyes**, shown on their companion share page; deliberately distinct from the private `notes`; §20). Buyers are Contacts — **there is no Buyer table**. `address` also resolves an in-person stud service's away-board location (§19). |
| **Kennel** | `kennel_name` | `is_own_kennel`, `prefix`, `location`, `website` (plain, unindexed — a link for this kennel, mirrors `Dog.url`), `logo_data_url` (plain, unindexed — a downscaled PNG/SVG **data URL** for the kennel's logo, uploaded/removed on the kennel detail page, rendered on its invoices/receipts (§24) and puppy records (§23); rides the JSON backup), `preferred_tests[]`, `preferred_breeds[]`, `promote_nudge_enabled` (bool, default off), `promote_age_male_months`/`promote_age_female_months` (the promote-lifecycle nudge's per-kennel thresholds, §19). Lightweight; added inline from the Contact form. |
| **Pairing** | `sire_id`, `dam_id`, `pairing_type`, `status` | `method`, `planned_date` (shown as "Planned first date" — the first planned/tie date), `last_observed_date` (plain, unindexed — a subsequent observed tie/breeding date), `expected_due_date` (prefilled on the detail page as 63 days after `planned_date` when still empty, never clobbering a deliberate edit), `notes`. Sire ≠ dam (hard block). |
| **Litter** | `dam_id`, `sire_id`, `status` | `nickname` (plain, unindexed — optional friendly label, e.g. "Party of Five"; when set it leads the detail-page title and shows as its own column on the Litters list and report, searchable across all three; falls back to `dam × sire` when blank), `pairing_id`, `whelp_date`, `accept_deposits_date` (plain, unindexed — when the breeder begins accepting deposits; on the detail page it sits between `whelp_date` and `estimated_ready_date`, and surfaces in the **prospective** companion bundle between "Born" and "Estimated ready" when set, §20), `estimated_ready_date` (plain, unindexed — prefilled as 8 weeks/56 days after `whelp_date` when still empty, never clobbering a deliberate edit), `litter_registration_number`, `puppies_born_total/alive/deceased/abnormalities` (the last a count, not mutually exclusive with alive/deceased), `expected_price_male`/`expected_price_female`/`expected_deposit_male`/`expected_deposit_female` (plain, unindexed — per-litter defaults, grouped by sex on the detail page; `sale.js` prefills a new Sale's `price` and `deposit_amount` from the matching-sex pair by the puppy's `sex`, only into fields still empty), `foster_direction` (plain, unindexed — nullable `foster_in`/`foster_out`; null = an ordinary litter. **Foster is a per-litter fact** (guide §25): the same dam can have foster and non-foster litters, so it can't live on the Dog. A foster puppy is distinguished from a plain "external" dog purely by DERIVATION of its litter's `foster_direction` — it stays a normal `status='puppy'` Dog we manage and sell), `foster_partner_contact_id` (**indexed FK → Contact**; the counterparty — the dam's owner for foster-in, the caretaker for foster-out — guarded in `CONTACT_REFERENCES`; its `kennel_id` is the owner/caretaker kennel a companion share can reveal), `foster_comp_model` (plain, unindexed — `income_split`/`flat_per_pup`; how the partner is paid), `foster_our_share_pct`/`foster_split_basis` (the income-split terms), `foster_flat_fee_per_pup` (the per-pup flat fee), `foster_split_notes` (all plain, unindexed — documentation of the terms for either model; the actual payout to the other party is a real `foster_split` ("Foster compensation") Expense, never a stored derived number), `notes`. The litter's own sire/dam are authoritative. Puppy roster is **derived** (`Dog WHERE litter_id`). |
| **Sale** | `dog_id`, `buyer_contact_id`, `placement_type`, `status` | `sale_date`, `price`, `deposit_amount`, `deposit_date`, `balance_due_date`, `balance_paid_date`, `transport_fee` (plain, unindexed — a flat delivery/transport charge, decimal), `deferred_boarding_amount`/`deferred_boarding_frequency`/`deferred_boarding_duration_days` (plain, unindexed — a boarding rate for a buyer who delayed pickup: decimal amount + `BOARDING_FREQUENCY_OPTIONS` Day/Week/Month + a free-text **count of frequency units** (despite the `_days` name, the value is the number of units — `2` with frequency `Week` means two weeks), rendered as "amount per frequency × count"; the family companion bundle multiplies `amount × count` into a deferred-pickup total feeding the computed remaining balance (§20); never cents, never an Expense — see §21), `lead_source`, `referred_by_contact_id` (indexed FK → the Contact who referred this buyer; `CONTACT_REFERENCES`; on save `saleRepo` auto-tags that contact `buyer_referrer` via `contactRepo.ensureType`), `payment_method`/`payment_reference`/`invoice_number`/`invoice_notes` (plain, unindexed — invoice/receipt document fields set from the Financials generator modal; §24), `notes`. On the detail page (`sale.js`) all fee fields render/edit above all date fields. Its own table (not a Dog field) so reserve/return/re-place stay distinct facts. |
| **Contract** | `contract_type` | `status` (defaults `draft`), `related_sale_id`, `related_stud_service_id`, `related_dog_id` (canonical Dog link, used only for `lease`/`co_own`/`foster`/`other` types — where no linked Sale/StudService reaches a dog; forced `null` for other types via `contractRepo.DOG_LINK_TYPES`/`normalizeLinks`), `related_contact_id` (canonical counterparty link — lessee/co-owner/partner/foster owner — for the same `lease`/`co_own`/`foster`/`other` types via `CONTACT_LINK_TYPES`; sale/stud contracts reach their counterparty through the linked Sale/StudService, so it stays `null` there; scopes a contract into the **partner** companion bundle, §20), `document_url` (plain, unindexed — a share link to the signed document, e.g. a Drive "anyone with the link" URL; carried as a *pointer* into the buyer bundle, §20), `signed_date`, `lease_start_date`/`lease_end_date` (lease type; UI shows them and hides Related sale/stud fields when `contract_type='lease'`), `title`, `terms_summary`, `notes`. Generic across sale/stud/co-ownership/lease. Leaf for its own hard-delete (nothing points *at* a contract), but it points *at* its Dog via `related_dog_id` (guarded under `DOG_REFERENCES`) and its counterparty via `related_contact_id` (guarded under `CONTACT_REFERENCES`). |
| **StudService** | `direction`, `our_dog_id`, `partner_dog_id`, `partner_contact_id`, `status` | `pairing_id`, `fee_amount`, `fee_structure`, `pick_status` (plain, unindexed — suggested `pending`/`claimed`, free text allowed; meaningful **only** when `fee_structure ∈ {pick_of_litter, flat_plus_pick}`, forced `null` otherwise; feeds the partner companion bundle's compensation, §20), `pick_value_amount` (plain, unindexed decimal — the breeder's own estimated dollar value of the pick puppy, for income tracking; gated the same way as `pick_status`; deliberately **separate** from `fee_amount` (the actual cash); internal only — never in the partner bundle), `result_notes`, `type` (`in_person`/`ai` — coarse physical-travel flag; `in_person` + `sent_date`/`returned_date` window feeds the away-board, §19), `referred_by_contact_id` (indexed FK → the referring Contact; `CONTACT_REFERENCES`; on save `studServiceRepo` auto-tags `stud_referrer` via `contactRepo.ensureType`), `payment_method`/`payment_reference`/`invoice_number`/`invoice_notes` (plain, unindexed — invoice/receipt document fields, mirroring Sale's; only the outgoing direction is invoiceable, since incoming stud is an expense; §24), plus optional logistics dates. Covers both `incoming` and `outgoing`. |
| **Event** | `subject_type`, `subject_id`, `event_type`, `event_date`, `title` | `event_end_date`, `reminder_date`, `reminder_dismissed`, `related_dog_id`, `related_contact_id`, `details{}`, `notes`. See §8. **No `cost` field** — a cost entered on the event form is written to the Expense ledger (`expenses.event_id` = the event) and read back via `expenseRepo.getByEvent`; see the Expense row and §21. |
| **Expense** | `subject_type` (`dog`/`litter`/`pairing`/`kennel`), `subject_id`, `amount`, `category`, `expense_date` | `event_id` (nullable FK → the Event a cost was captured from — the one canonical event↔cost link; reverse is `expenseRepo.getByEvent`), `miles`/`mileage_rate` (plain, unindexed — a **mileage** expense: when `miles` is set, `amount` is **derived** = `miles × mileage_rate` in `expenseRepo.normalize`, never entered directly; both null on a flat expense. Default rate prefilled from `settings.getMileageDefaults()`; §21), `vendor`, `receipt_number` (plain, unindexed — a human-facing receipt/reference number printed on the receipt, not an id of anything in KennelOS; auto-filled by OCR off a scanned receipt when found (§26.1) and editable, shown/edited on both expense forms and the Financials ledger, searchable there, and the idempotent key on CSV re-import when present, §9), `receipt_file_id` (plain, unindexed FK → the `files` row holding the attached receipt — a photo/screenshot compressed to PDF, or an uploaded PDF, attached via the receipt-capture widget; deleted with the expense in `expenseRepo.hardDelete`; §26.1), `reimbursable`/`reimbursed_date` (plain, unindexed — a cost owed back to you, e.g. a foster-in rearing cost the dam's owner reimburses; `reimbursed_date` records when it was settled, and a set date coerces `reimbursable=true`. Litter P&L nets a reimbursed reimbursable out of your cost and lists a pending one as a receivable — §21/§25. "Reimbursable to whom" is derived from the litter's foster partner, so no per-expense contact FK), `notes`. The Financials ledger: the single home for money spent. Polymorphic like Event; `kennel`-subject rows are kennel-wide overhead. Leaf entity (`EXPENSE_REFERENCES` empty). See §21. |
| **Document** | `dog_id`, `doc_type` (`pedigree`/`health_test`/`registration`/`contract`/`other`), `file_id` | `title`, `doc_date`, `issuer_or_lab`, `result`, `registry`, `registration_number`, `notes`. A filed document belonging to exactly one Dog (`dog_id`, guarded in `DOG_REFERENCES`) and pointing at exactly one stored `files` row (`file_id`) — the reverse "a dog's documents" is `documentRepo.getByDog`. Which optional fields show on the form is keyed by `doc_type` (`vocab.documentFieldsFor`). Leaf entity (`DOCUMENT_REFERENCES` empty); `hardDelete` also removes the linked file. See §26.1. |
| **File** (`files`) | `blob`, `mime`, `filename`, `size`, `created_at` | `thumbnail` (a small JPEG data-URL for photo-sourced files; blank for uploaded PDFs, which show a doc-type icon). The blob archive behind **both** Documents (`documents.file_id`) and expense receipts (`expenses.receipt_file_id`) — every file is a PDF (photos are compressed to PDF by `pdfBuild.js` before storage). Fetched by id only; not an orphan-guarded entity — a file is owned by its one Document/Expense and deleted with it. `blob` is base64-round-tripped through backups (§5). See §26.1. |

### 4.2 Relationship direction — the sixth design principle

**Every relationship has exactly ONE canonical stored side; the reverse is always a
derived query, never a second stored pointer.** So:

- Litter→Pairing is stored as `Litter.pairing_id`; a pairing's litter is
  `litterRepo.getForPairing`. There is no `Pairing.litter_id`.
- StudService→Pairing is stored as `StudService.pairing_id`;
  `studServiceRepo.getByPairing` is the reverse. There is no `Pairing.stud_service_id`.
- Contract→Sale / →StudService / →Dog / →Contact are stored on the Contract
  (`related_sale_id`, `related_stud_service_id`, `related_dog_id`,
  `related_contact_id` — the last two for `lease`/`co_own`/`other` contracts).
  Sales/stud-services/dogs/contacts carry no contract pointer;
  `contractRepo.getBySale`/`getByStudService`/`getByDog`/`getByContact` are the reverse.
- A Dog's children, a Contact's dogs, a Kennel's contacts — all derived queries over
  the indexed FK.
- Expense→Event is stored as `Expense.event_id` (the money owns the link); an event's
  cost is `expenseRepo.getByEvent`. There is no `Event.expense_id`/`Event.cost`.
  Expense→subject (dog/litter/pairing/kennel) is the polymorphic
  `[subject_type+subject_id]`; a subject's expenses are `expenseRepo.getForSubject`.

When you need "the reverse of X," write a query. Do not add a mirror field.

### 4.3 Two decisions that are settled — do not re-litigate

- **One `Dog` table** for breeding stock, puppies, and external dogs. A life-stage
  change is a `status` update on the same record, never a new row.
- **One `Event` table** for all dated history, polymorphic via
  `subject_type`/`subject_id`. No per-type event tables.

## 5. Dexie schema (`data/db.js`)

DB name: `KennelOSBreedingApp`. All twelve tables live in a **single collapsed
`version(1)` block**. Indexes:

litters:       id, pairing_id, sire_id, dam_id, status, whelp_date,
               foster_partner_contact_id, is_archived
sales:         id, dog_id, buyer_contact_id, referred_by_contact_id, status,
               placement_type, is_archived

```

Index notes:
- `events.[subject_type+subject_id]` **and** `expenses.[subject_type+subject_id]` are
  **compound** indexes (fast per-subject timeline / ledger). Do not split them.
- `expenses.event_id` is indexed so `expenseRepo.getByEvent` is an index probe.
  `expenses.category`/`expense_date` back the Financials report's filters.
- `sales.referred_by_contact_id` and `stud_services.referred_by_contact_id` are the
  referral FKs, guarded in `CONTACT_REFERENCES`.
- `dogs.*co_owner_contact_ids` is a **multi-entry** index ("dogs co-owned by X").
- `documents` (§26.1) is indexed on `dog_id` (a dog's document list), `doc_type`
  (the type filter chips), and `doc_date` (newest-first sort). `files` — the blob
  archive backing both Documents and `expenses.receipt_file_id` — is fetched only by
  id, so only `created_at` (backup ordering) is indexed. `expenses.receipt_file_id`
  is a **plain, unindexed** FK into `files` (fetched by id only, never queried on).
- `events.reminder_date` is indexed for the reminder engine's range probe. Every other
  canonical FK is indexed so reverse lookups are index probes, not scans.
- **Unindexed but persisted:** `events.event_end_date`, `events.reminder_dismissed`,
  `dogs.recorded_coi`, plus every non-indexed field. They persist and ride backups;
  they simply aren't queryable by key.
- **Binary, base64 in backups:** `files.blob` is a real `Blob` — the schema's only
  binary field. JSON can't hold a Blob, so `importExport.js` base64-tags it on export
  and rehydrates it on restore (`BACKUP_FORMAT_VERSION` 2). This is what keeps stored
  documents/receipts durable across the JSON backup **and** the Dropbox sync (both go
  through `exportAll`/`restoreBackup`). Any future Blob field must round-trip the same
  way — a plain `JSON.stringify` silently drops a Blob to `{}`.
- `is_archived` is filtered in JS, not by index (IndexedDB can't key on booleans;
  trivial at kennel scale).

Everything lives in that one `version(1)` block, including later additions like
`litters.foster_partner_contact_id` (§25, the referential guard for a foster partner
Contact) and the `documents`/`files` tables (§26.1) — `foster_direction`, the foster split
fields, and every other non-indexed field are plain unindexed and so are not in the strings.

### The versioning rule

The `version(1)` block is edited **in place**: add or change a table or index right in that
block, then reconcile the change with **Reset App to Start** + re-seed — schema and seed data
move together, and there is no separate migration path.

---

## 6. The repo layer

`repoBase.js`'s `makeRepo(tableName, references)` gives every entity the same thin
surface; each entity repo wraps it to add validation and derived queries.

Uniform surface:
- `getById(id)`
- `getAll({ includeArchived = false })` — archived filtered in JS
- `create(data)` — assigns `id` (UUID), `is_archived=false`, timestamps
- `update(id, changes)` — merges, preserves `id`/`created_at`, bumps `updated_at`
- `archive(id)` / `unarchive(id)` — soft delete (the normal "remove")
- `getDeleteBlockers(id)` — reference blockers without deleting (for UI)
- `hardDelete(id)` — blocked if any reference exists (throws `ReferenceBlockedError`)

Conventions each entity repo follows:
- `create`/`update` run a `validate<Entity>` first, then delegate to base. Update
  validates the **merged** result so partial updates are checked as a whole.
- Only hard, non-interactive rules live in the repo (required fields, cycle prevention,
  sire≠dam). Soft/interactive warnings (sex mismatch, date ordering, "leaving
  deceased") belong to the page UI — a repo can't prompt.
- Derived reverse-lookup helpers live on the repo (e.g. `dogRepo.getChildren`,
  `contactRepo.getDogs`, `contractRepo.getBySale`).

Notable repo specifics:
- **dogRepo**: pedigree cycle prevention in `validateDog` (walks ancestors with a
  visited-set); `addPlannedTests` (additive, dedupe-on-write); `getBreeds`.
- **eventRepo** (exported as both `HistoryEvent` and `eventRepo`): see §8.
- **saleRepo.isOpenSale(sale)**: true when a sale is non-archived and its status is not
  in `{delivered, returned, cancelled}`. Drives family-companion membership (§20) and
  the "open sale" filter.
- **contractRepo.governingContract(contracts)**: derived "live contract" = most recent
  `signed` by `signed_date` (fallback `created_at`), or null. Never stored.
  **contractRepo.isLivePartnerContract(c, today)**: non-archived, counterparty set, not
  a terminal status (`declined`/`cancelled`/`void`), and — for a lease — not past
  `lease_end_date`. Drives partner-companion membership and the partner bundle's
  contract block (§20), so the two can't drift.
- **kennelRepo**: `preferred_tests`/`preferred_breeds` authoring (dedupe-on-write;
  remove drops membership only, never purges a token another event may need);
  `getVocabulary`/`getBreedVocabulary` union over own-kennels.
- **expenseRepo**: `getForSubject`, `getByEvent`/`getOneByEvent`, and `total(rows)`. See §21.
- **contactRepo.ensureType(id, type)**: adds a `contact_type` role if missing (no-op
  otherwise). `saleRepo`/`studServiceRepo` call it on save to auto-tag a
  `referred_by_contact_id` as `buyer_referrer`/`stud_referrer`.

Two derived aggregators live in `data/` but are not repos and own no table:
- **incomeView** (`incomeView.js`): `getIncomeRows({includeArchived})` and
  `summarize(rows)` read Sale + outgoing StudService and classify each money component
  earned/anticipated for the Financials Income & Overview views. Each sale row also
  carries `dog_id`/`litter_id` (the puppy's litter) so income rolls up per litter. Also
  exports `incomeLineItems(sourceType, record)` — the cash line items (drops the
  non-cash `pick`, tags each with its label) the invoice/receipt generator builds from,
  so a document can't show a component the ledger wouldn't. Stores nothing; recomputed on
  every load. See §21 and §24.
- **litterFinances** (`litterFinances.js`): `getLitterFinances()` — one P&L row per
  litter for the **Litter P&L** report: puppy-sale income (earned/anticipated via
  incomeView, grouped by `litter_id`) vs the full litter cost (litter-subject expenses
  **plus** each puppy's dog-subject expenses) and the net. Stores nothing. See §21.

> Module naming trap: the Event repo's JS object is `HistoryEvent`/`eventRepo`, **never
> a bare `Event`** — that would collide with the DOM global.

---

## 7. Referential integrity (`data/referenceRegistry.js`)

Hard delete is the rare "undo a data-entry mistake" action; **soft delete (archive) is
the normal remove and never cascades**.

- Each entity has a declared array of every FK that can point at it (`DOG_REFERENCES`,
  `CONTACT_REFERENCES`, …). `findBlockingReferences(registry, id)` counts matching rows
  per entry and returns human-readable `{label, count}` blockers; `hardDelete` throws
  `ReferenceBlockedError` if any exist.
- `CONTACT_REFERENCES` covers owner/co-owner of a dog, buyer + referrer on a sale,
  partner + referrer on a stud service, contact on a boarding event, the
  lease/co_own/foster/other contract counterparty, and the **foster partner on a
  litter** (`litters.foster_partner_contact_id`, §25) — so a contact documented anywhere
  can't be hard-deleted out from under it.
- `EVENT_REFERENCES` is `[{ expenses.event_id }]`: an event carrying a linked expense is
  hard-delete-blocked (archive it, or clear the Cost first). `eventRepo` is
  `makeRepo('events', EVENT_REFERENCES)`.
- `DOG_/LITTER_/PAIRING_/KENNEL_REFERENCES` each carry an `expenses.subject_id` entry
  (compound-index + discriminator), so a subject can't be hard-deleted out from under its
  expenses.
- `DOG_REFERENCES` also carries a `documents.dog_id` entry (§26.1), so a dog with filed
  documents can't be hard-deleted out from under them.
- `Contract`, `Expense`, and `Document` are leaves (empty `CONTRACT_REFERENCES` /
  `EXPENSE_REFERENCES` / `DOCUMENT_REFERENCES` — nothing points *at* them). A `files`
  row is **not** in the registry: it is owned by exactly one Document (`documents.file_id`)
  or one Expense (`expenses.receipt_file_id`) and is deleted alongside its owner in that
  repo's `hardDelete`, never orphan-guarded.
- The guard **skips any table not present in the current schema** — so it can't rot;
  adding a referencing table later is one appended line.
- The polymorphic Event/Expense subject is matched via the compound index with a
  discriminator (`{compoundIndex:'[subject_type+subject_id]', discriminatorValue:'dog'|
  'pairing'|…}`).
- The blocking message is generated entirely from the registry, so it always matches the
  tables that actually exist — no hand-maintained carve-outs.

**When you add an FK anywhere, add its line to the registry** or hard-delete will
silently allow orphaning.

---

## 8. The Event model

One polymorphic table for all dated history. `subject_type ∈ {dog, pairing, litter}` +
`subject_id` say what it's attached to. The type catalog lives in `vocab.js`
`EVENT_TYPES`; each type carries:

> **Cost lives in the ledger, not on the Event.** The event form shows a "Cost" (+
> "Cost category") field, but on save it upserts an `Expense` carrying `event_id` = this
> event and the event's own subject; clearing the field removes that linked expense. The
> timeline reads the amount back via `expenseRepo.getByEvent`. See §21.
- `subjects[]` — which subject types may log it (`eventTypesFor(subjectType)` filters).
- `duration` — `'instant'` (single date) or `'span'` (`event_date` start, optional
  `event_end_date` end). Spans: `medication`, `heat_cycle`, `boarding`.
- `badge` — colour class.
- `fields[]` — the small type-specific form written into `details{}`. Field types:
  `text`, `textarea`, `number` (optional `step`), `date`, `combobox`
  (suggest-not-enforce), `select` (enforced, options[] only).
- `relatedContact: true` — surfaces the top-level `related_contact_id` FK (boarding,
  placement). Contacts on events are the canonical FK, never a `details` value.

**Placement specifics:** `dropoff_method` (`select`, enforced choice from
`PLACEMENT_METHODS` — Flight nanny / Ground transport / Local pickup / Other) sits first
in the form, directly above `placement_time`. A deferred-pickup boarding rate lives on
**`Sale`**, not here — see §5's Sale row and §21's money note.

Test-bearing types (`genetic_test`, `breed_specific_test`, `ofa_pennhip`) feed the
shared test vocabulary; `testTokensOf(event)` derives the test-name token(s).

**Litter-wide cascade** (`litter.js`'s "Log event for whole litter" → `openEventForm`'s
`cascadeTargets`): normally every checked puppy gets one Event with the *same*
`details{}`. `weight_check` is the one exception — `eventForm.js`'s
`PER_TARGET_CASCADE_FIELDS` names `weight_lbs`/`weight_oz` as per-target, so each checked
puppy gets its own weight inputs while `time_of_day` stays a single shared field. Add a
type to that map to give any other field the same per-puppy treatment.

**Weight-regression warning** (`eventForm.js` `save()`): saving a `weight_check` whose
value is **below the same dog's previous weigh-in** raises a soft confirm ("Weight
decreased — Save anyway?"), never a hard block (soft/interactive checks are the page's job,
not the repo's, per §6). It's checked **per dog**, so a litter-wide bulk weight-add lists
exactly which puppies dropped (and by how much). Comparison is total ounces (`lbs×16 + oz`)
against the dog's **immediately preceding** `weight_check` (`findPriorWeighIn`, excluding the
event being edited); a weight with no prior to compare against, or one that held/rose, saves
silently. "Preceding" is a **same-day AM/PM-aware total order** (`weighKey`/`keyCmp`: date →
AM-before-PM via `time_of_day` → capture time), so two weigh-ins on one day sort correctly — a
PM compares against that morning's AM, and an AM compares against the prior day rather than a
later-in-the-day PM.

### eventRepo reads (all siblings — deliberately never fused)

- `getForSubject(type, id)` — the timeline, newest first (compound index).
- `getBoardRows()` — dogs currently away via boarding events: `event_type='boarding'`,
  not archived, not yet ended. Whereabouts only — **not** all spans. This is ONE half of
  the away-board; `data/awayBoard.js` `getAwayBoardRows()` unions it with
  `studServiceRepo.getBoardRows()` (in-person stud services) into one view-model — §19.
- `getUpcoming()` — instant-duration events at/after today, any subject ("Upcoming
  Deliverables").
- `getScheduledPlacements()` — future `placement` events only.
- `getReminders()` / `getDismissedReminders()` — events with a non-null `reminder_date`,
  not archived, split by `reminder_dismissed`. `reminder_date` is the app's **one**
  future-dated mechanism. Bucketing into overdue/due-soon/upcoming is a display concern
  (30-day window), computed in the page, not the repo.
- Reminder mutations: `dismissReminder`/`undismissReminder` (not archiving, not a status
  change) and `snoozeReminder` (snooze **is** a `reminder_date` edit — there is no
  separate snooze field).

The overdue/due-soon boundary (`DUE_SOON_DAYS = 30`) is duplicated as a UI constant in
`reminders.js` and `dashboard.js`; keep them equal if you change it.

---

## 9. CSV import (`data/csvImport.js`)

Generic, entity-agnostic match-or-create engine used through the shared
`assets/importView.js` UI (the **expense** importer is the one exception — it reuses this
engine for parsing/classification but renders its own subject-attach review screen; see the
Expense mapping below). Every import is a **dry-run preview** (create / update /
needs-review) before any write.

Flow: `parseCsv` (PapaParse; headers → lower_snake_case, values trimmed) →
`buildPlan(entity, rows)` → user reviews/adjusts decisions → `commitPlan`.

Rules that shape everything:
- **Natural key must be non-empty.** Keyless/partial-key rows are always "needs review" —
  never auto-matched, never silently created.
- Name match is case-insensitive + trimmed; dates exact. Enum/date cells normalize to a
  value, `''` (blank), or `null` (present but unrecognized → flagged).
- Relationship columns (sire/dam/dog names) resolve against **existing** records only; an
  unresolved name is flagged, never invented.
- **Two deliberate exceptions** auto-create a Contact inline at commit (never a stall):
  Sale's `buyer_name` and StudService's `partner_contact_name`, via each mapping's
  `prepareRecord` hook.

Per-entity natural keys: Dog = name+DOB; Contact = name; Pairing = sire+dam+planned;
Litter = dam+sire+whelp; Sale = dog+buyer+sale_date; Event (dog-subject only) =
dog+type+date (title tiebreak); StudService = our_dog+partner_dog+direction (no date, so
any existing match is always routed to review); Expense = subject+expense_date+amount+
category+vendor (idempotent re-import — the same file updates, never duplicates).

**Expense mapping (the Receipts-app import path, §21).** The ledger's external-tool
in-road: a companion receipts/mileage app (or any spreadsheet) emits one row per cost and
this brings it into the Expense ledger with the same dry-run discipline. Columns:
`subject_type`, `subject_name`, `expense_date`, `amount`, `category`, `vendor`, `miles`,
`mileage_rate`, `receipt_number`, `notes`. **Subject resolution** covers the two subjects a
name-only tool can express: `subject_type='kennel'` (the default when blank — program
overhead) resolves by kennel name, or by the configured "my kennel" / sole own kennel when
`subject_name` is blank; `subject_type='dog'` resolves by registered/call name (an ambiguous
name is flagged, never guessed). `litter`/`pairing` subjects have no name key, so the CSV
can't name them — **but the expense importer's review UI lets you attach any row to a litter/
pairing (or reassign its dog/kennel) by hand before commit** (see below). **Mileage:** a row
with `miles` set is a mileage expense — `category` is forced to `mileage`, `mileage_rate`
falls back to `settings.getMileageDefaults().rate` when blank, and `amount` is left for
`expenseRepo` to derive (miles × rate), never taken from the file. **Idempotent key:** when a
row carries a `receipt_number`, that IS the natural key (`rcpt <n>`), so the same receipt
always maps to the same ledger row and re-import updates it in place even if amount/date/
subject changed; without one, the key is the composite subject+date+amount+category+vendor.
Either way the match index only considers **non-archived, non-event-linked** ledger rows, so
a re-import can never clobber a cost captured from the event form. The CSV import carries
**no image** — only the extracted money data (and the `receipt_number` back-pointer) crosses
over. To attach the receipt image itself to a ledger row, use the in-app receipt capture on
the expense form (§26.1); the importer doesn't touch files.

**The expense importer has its own review screen** (`pages/expense-import.js`) — the one
importer that does **not** use the shared `assets/importView.js`. Because an Expense is
polymorphic (every row must attach to a subject), it reuses the parse + `buildPlan('expense',…)`
engine for all field parsing / classification / receipt-number keying, but renders its own
table so each row gets an editable **"Attach to"** control (subject-type dropdown + subject
picker, prefilled from the CSV's name resolution, reassignable to any dog/litter/pairing/
kennel) before commit. Commit writes straight through `expenseRepo.create`/`update` with the
chosen subject. This is the "relate each imported expense to a dog or litter" surface.

To add an entity to the importer: write one mapping object (`{entity, label,
templateHeaders, requiredForCreate, loadExisting, buildIndex, classify, describe, repo,
prepareRecord?}`) and register it in `MAPPINGS`. Don't rebuild the engine.

> Keep this file clean UTF-8 (no BOM). It contains user-facing review strings.

---

## 10. JSON backup / restore (`data/importExport.js`)

The cross-device data path. This module may use `db` directly (it's in the data layer,
doing cross-table transaction work).

- `exportAll()` iterates **whatever tables exist** (no hardcoded list) → `{ schema_version,
  format_version, exported_at, collections }`. `downloadBackup()` saves it and stamps
  `lastBackupDate`.
- `inspectBackup(obj)` validates shape and reports counts + unknown tables before any
  write.
- `restoreBackup(obj, mode)`:
  - `'replace'` — clears **every** known table first, then loads the file's rows, so the
    result is exactly the backup (a table the file omits ends up empty).
  - `'merge'` — upserts the file's rows by id, leaving other records intact.
  - Unknown collections (tables not in this schema version) are skipped, not errors.

`BACKUP_FORMAT_VERSION` bumps only when the on-disk shape changes in a migration-requiring
way.

---

## 11. First-run, sample data, seed, settings

- **settings.js** — the primary `localStorage` user. Pages never touch `localStorage`
  directly. Keys (all under `kennelOS.*`): `lastBackupDate`, `persistRequested`,
  `sampleDataManifest`, `sampleDataCleared`, `myKennelId`, `myContactId`,
  `myKennelSetupSkipped`, `companion` (the Companion feature's per-type message templates
  — Layer 1, §20 — one JSON object keyed by recipient type via
  `getCompanionSettings`/`setCompanionSettings`), `invoiceDefaults` (the invoice
  generator's default accepted payment methods, §24, via
  `getInvoiceDefaults`/`setInvoiceDefaults`), `mileageDefaults` (the add-expense form's
  default rate per mile for mileage entries, §21, via
  `getMileageDefaults`/`setMileageDefaults`), `dropbox` (the Dropbox connection blob —
  refresh token, cached access token, in-flight PKCE verifier; the app key itself is
  hardcoded in `data/dropbox.js`, not stored here — §26, via
  `getDropboxSettings`/`setDropboxSettings`/`clearDropboxSettings`), `assistantLastSync`
  (when the KennelAssistant page last pulled the dog feed, §26). `clearAllSettings()`
  drops them all (used by Reset App).
- **nudgeState.js** — a second, deliberately separate `localStorage` module (one key,
  `kennelOS.nudgeDismissals`): the derived-nudge dismissal ledger (§19). Kept out of
  `settings.js`/`clearAllSettings()` on purpose — `appReset.js` calls its own `clearAll()`
  directly — and never exported in JSON backups: dismissals are device-local UI state, not
  portable domain data.
- **sampleData.js** — the "Thornfield Kennels" demo. Seeds through the **repo layer** (same
  validation as real data) and tracks created IDs in one manifest object (not an
  `is_sample` schema flag), so clearing is a lookup, not a scan. Deliberately **broad**
  (Tutorial Sample-Data Coverage Spec §6, Phase 2) so a first-run tour can point at a live
  example on every hub: a two-breed program (Boston Terriers **and** Boxers), a priced,
  actively-selling **Autumn litter** with an open sale (transport fee + deferred-boarding
  balance math), an **expected** litter, a lease (leased-in Boxer + `lease` contract) and a
  `co_own` contract, an **incoming AI** stud service, and dates tuned so seven of the eight
  Today nudges (§19) are live on a fresh seed — the litter→**close** rule is intentionally
  not live (it needs a `sold` litter whose placed pups are all `delivered`, which conflicts
  with the reopen/sold anchors and the packet size, per the spec's §9.3). Companion has ≥1
  recipient on all three tabs (prospective / current families / partners). Editing this file
  still bumps `CACHE_NAME` (§ service worker); it adds no new file or FK.
- **seedImport.js** — optional breed+test vocabulary seed (from
  `resources/common_tests_by_breed_seed.csv` or a user file). Appends to
  `Kennel.preferred_tests` / `preferred_breeds`; creates **no** records. Deliberately
  **not** routed through the csvImport engine (different shape). Used by both the standalone
  import page and the kennel-setup wizard.
- **kennelSetup.js** — the "your kennel and owner name" wizard; creates real
  Kennel/Contact records and remembers them by id in settings.
- **appReset.js** — `resetApp()` clears every table + all settings → the exact blank slate
  a never-visited browser sees.

First-run flow (`app.js` → `runFirstRunOnboarding()` in **`assets/onboardingUI.js`**):
request durable storage once, then — on a genuinely fresh install (`shouldOfferFirstRunPrompt()`)
— show a short card sequence: a **non-dismissible Welcome** card (what the app is), then a
**tour offer** ("Show me around!" / "No thanks, I'll explore"). The two branches:
- **"Show me around!"** → seed the Thornfield sample data, `startWizard()`, and reload so the
  destination page's `runWizardStep()` picks the tour up. Sample data is seeded **only** on
  this path.
- **"No thanks…"** → `declineSampleData()` (a blank kennel, no sample data ever), a
  **backups + install-as-app** card, then the **New Kennel** kennel-setup modal.

On a non-fresh load the onboarding no-ops and `app.js` falls through to `maybeShowKennelSetupPrompt()`
(which fires on the load right after sample data is cleared). `sampleDataUI.js` owns only the
persistent banner + the shared Clear-sample-data flow.

**Guided tour.** A spotlight coach-mark tour of the seeded Thornfield packet — a pure
UI/state feature that reads existing records (never writes app data) and persists its own
progress in `localStorage` via `settings.js` (`wizardStatus` + `wizardStepIndex`), no Dexie
table, no schema, no `referenceRegistry.js` entry. Three modules: **`data/wizardState.js`**
(the status/index state machine, `isTourAvailable()` gating the tour on the Thornfield seed
being active, `isIntroStep()`, and the `HIGHLIGHT_STEPS` list the "Step n of N" counter uses),
**`data/wizardSteps.js`** (the static ordered `WIZARD_STEPS` catalog — data only, like
`vocab.js`), and **`assets/wizardUI.js`** (the box-shadow spotlight overlay, the cards, the
nav "Take the tour" entry, and the free-navigation "Resume tour" pill). The tour can also be
relaunched from the **Import / Export** page's "Guided tour" section — a button that calls
`restartWizard()` + `runWizardStep()` (its opening card is a page-agnostic intro, so it appears
in place); it and the nav entry share the `isTourAvailable()` gate, so both hide once the sample
data is cleared. The catalog has two
step **kinds**: an **intro** step (`kind: 'tour-intro'` or `'hub-intro'`) is a centered,
page-agnostic card with a single forward button (`step.button`, e.g. "Explore Today Hub →")
— one tour-intro leads the tour, and a hub-intro precedes each hub's stops; a **highlight**
step (no `kind`) spotlights a real element and pins a compact card to the **top** of the
viewport, scrolling its target to sit just below so the card never covers it (a target pinned
too high on its page to clear the top card flips the card to the **bottom** of the viewport
instead; a `ResizeObserver` re-positions the target as a content-heavy page's sections load in,
so a late reflow can't leave it off-screen; and it falls back to a centered card if the target
never appears). **Finishing** the tour (the last step's "Finish") mirrors the "I'll explore"
onboarding ending: it shows the closing card, then `clearSampleData()` removes the Thornfield
seed and hands off to the kennel-setup modal (`showKennelSetupModal`). `app.js`'s shared `boot()` calls `runWizardStep()`
unconditionally on every page — the only wizard hook; no page file is wizard-aware.
Detail-page highlight steps carry an `anchor` slug that `wizardUI.js` resolves to the current
seed's real id at runtime via the `manifest.named` map the seed writes (the seed uses runtime
`crypto.randomUUID()` ids, so links can only resolve per-seed). See
`docs/Wizard_Runtime_Spec_v1.md` for the original design (the first-run trigger and the
intro-card / pinned-top-card presentation postdate it).

---

## 12. Service worker / PWA (`sw.js`)

App-shell cache so the app installs and works offline after first load.

- `CACHE_NAME` (currently `kennelos-shell-v5`) + a `PRECACHE_URLS` list of **every** app
  file (html/js/css/icons/vendor/resources).
- `install` precaches the list (**`cache.addAll` is atomic** — one missing/renamed file
  fails the whole install). `activate` deletes old caches. Fetch is **cache-first** for
  same-origin GETs, with runtime caching of anything new.

**The discipline that matters:** whenever you add, rename, or remove an app file — or edit
an existing one — you must (1) update `PRECACHE_URLS` and (2) bump `CACHE_NAME`. Because
fetch is cache-first, an installed client only picks up changes when `CACHE_NAME` changes.
Forgetting to precache a new module silently breaks offline for whatever imports it.

**Bump `CACHE_NAME` ask-first, once per shippable batch — not per edit.** `PRECACHE_URLS`
always tracks the file set as you go, but the `CACHE_NAME` bump is the *last* step and is
**not** something to do unprompted: make all the edits, then **ask the user to confirm the
batch is done** before bumping. In a long multi-turn session a bump every turn just churns
through versions — so once you've bumped within a session, that pending version **stands**
for further edits in the same session (it hasn't reached clients yet, so it still represents
the new set); only re-bump after a deploy actually ships or the user asks for a fresh
rollover. See CLAUDE.md for the same rule stated as the working checklist.

There is a maintenance check for this — see §16.

---

## 13. UI layer

### The two rendering frameworks — different escaping contracts

This distinction is the single easiest thing to get wrong. Learn it:

- **`assets/reportView.js`** — columns provide `value:(r)=>string` returning **plain text**;
  the framework escapes it (`esc`) before injecting. Return raw text; do not pre-escape.
  `badge` columns render a controlled-vocab badge. Has CSV export.
- **`assets/listView.js`** — columns provide `cell:(r)=>htmlString` returning **HTML**; the
  framework injects it **raw**. **The caller must `esc()` every user-controlled value inside
  `cell`.** Columns can be marked `sortable: true` with a `sortFn:(a,b)=>number` comparator
  to enable click-to-sort headers. Supports filters, "show archived", collapsible columns,
  grouping, optional CSV export.

When in doubt: `value` = text (auto-escaped), `cell` = HTML (you escape).

### Shared helpers (`assets/ui.js`)

`esc(s)` (HTML-escape — use it on every interpolated user value in hand-built innerHTML),
`badge`/`badges`, `fmtDate` (YYYY-MM-DD → localized), `param(name)` (read `?id=`),
`confirmAction` (and the styled modal dialogs). `todayYMD` is re-exported here but its one
implementation lives in `data/dateUtils.js`.

### Other components

- **timeline.js** — a subject's event list with add/edit/archive/delete; spans render as a
  date range; escapes all values.
- **pedigree.js** — derived ancestor tree from `sire_id`/`dam_id`; SVG connectors over
  positioned nodes. Bounded by a `generations` depth cap (default 3), which makes it
  cycle-safe regardless of data. Below the tree it renders a derived **Offspring** section —
  dogs whose `sire_id`/`dam_id` is the root — grouped by litter, sorted, with per-pup sex
  indicators.
- **eventForm.js** — add/edit-event modal; renders the type's `fields` into `details`,
  handles spans/reminders, persists empty optional dates as `null` (keeps them out of the
  reminder index). Supports applying one payload to multiple subjects. Also exports
  `openEventFromQuery(subjectType, subjectId, onSaved)` — since Event has no standalone page
  (polymorphic subject, §2), this is how `pages/today.js`'s Reminders and Due outs rows
  deep-link "into" an event: each row's button navigates to the subject's own page
  (`dog.html`/`pairing.html`/`litter.html`) with an extra query param, and that page's
  `main()` calls this once after loading its record. `openEvent=<id>` opens that exact event
  in edit mode; `logEvent=<event_type>` opens a fresh event of that type. Wired into
  `dog.js`/`pairing.js`/`litter.js` main() alongside their `new=1` prefill params.
- **puppyForm.js**, **importView.js**, **onboardingUI.js**, **sampleDataUI.js**,
  **kennelSetupUI.js** — roster entry, the CSV dry-run/commit UI, the first-run onboarding
  card sequence, the sample-data banner, and the kennel-setup modal.
- **contactPicker.js** — `attachNewContactButton(selectEl, {onCreated})` decorates any
  contact `<select>` with a "＋ New" button: minimal inline-create modal (name required),
  creates via `contactRepo.create`, appends+selects the option, fires a native `change`
  event. `onCreated` runs **before** that dispatch so a caller that re-renders the select
  from its own in-memory contact list (e.g. `sale.js`) sees the new contact already there.
  Wired into sale (buyer), stud-service (partner), and `eventForm.js` (boarding/placement
  related contact).
- **expensePanel.js** — the reusable per-subject expense ledger panel (§21).

### Navigation (`nav.js`)

Organized **by job, not by table**: six workflow hubs in the main bar — **Today / Dogs /
Breeding / People / Placements & Contracts / Financials** — plus a "More" corner menu for
**Reports**, **Companion** (§20), and **Import/Export**. Financials is a first-class hub,
not a report (money is operational; Reports are analytics queries). Detail/edit/import pages
are not nav entries; `HUB_CHILDREN` maps them to the hub tab that should light up. Links are
stored app-root-relative and prefixed at render time so they resolve from `index.html` or
`/pages/` and any GitHub Pages sub-path.

### Page catalog (`pages/`, one `.js` + `.html` each)

Hubs & landing: `today`, `dogs`, `breeding`, `contacts`, `sales`, `financials` (the
Financials hub — Overview / Income / Expenses toggle, §21), `reports`, `companion` (the
Companion Messaging console, §20), `import-export`, plus root `index.html`.
Dogs: `dog` (detail), `roster`, `pedigree`.
Breeding: `pairings`/`pairing`, `litters`/`litter`, `active-breeding`, `live-births`.
People: `contact`, `kennels` (list — identity CRUD only: name/prefix/location/own + archive/
delete; the add form stays collapsed behind a **+ Add New Kennel** button, and rows sort own
kennels first then everyone else's alphabetically by name) / `kennel` (detail — hosts that kennel's Expenses ledger plus, for own kennels, its
program configuration: the preferred-tests panel and the lifecycle-nudge thresholds). Both
map to the People hub in `HUB_CHILDREN`.
Placements/contracts: `sale`/`sales`, `stud-service`/`stud-services`, `contract`/`contracts`,
`puppy-record` (print-only puppy record, §23 — not a nav entry, reached from `sale`/`sales`).
Financials print docs: `invoice` (print-only invoice/receipt generator, §24 — not a nav
entry, reached from the Financials hub's "Invoice / Receipt" generator modal).
Documents: `documents` (filed dog documents — local file storage, in the "More" menu and
via a "📄 Documents" button on the dog page, §26.1).
Today cluster: `dashboard`, `reminders`, `upcoming`, `board`, `scheduled-placements`.
Reports: `litters-report`, `stud-services-report`, `placements-report`,
`health-tests-report`, `litter-finances-report` (Litter P&L; `data/litterFinances.js`).
Import pages: `dog-import`, `contact-import`, `pairing-import`, `litter-import`,
`sale-import`, `event-import`, `stud-service-import`, `expense-import`, `kennel-tests-import`.

## 14. Data conventions (quick reference)

- `id` = `crypto.randomUUID()`, client-side. No auto-increment.
- Soft delete only (`is_archived`). Never cascades, never destroys history.
- Date-only fields are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings compared **lexicographically**. Only
  `created_at`/`updated_at` are full ISO. "Today" is local wall-clock (`todayYMD`).
- Money is the app's native **decimal, never cents** — the shell/documents format it.
- Pickers exclude archived by default (toggle to include). Status/type = colored badges
  sourced from `vocab.js`.
- Controlled vocabularies live only in `vocab.js`; dropdowns and badges both read from it so
  they never drift.

---

## 15. Deliberately NOT built

Don't assume these exist; several are explicitly deferred "open doors":

- App-computed COI / relatedness / pairing-COI prediction (only a user-recorded
  `Dog.recorded_coi` exists).
- Genotype / Mendelian carrier-risk analysis; test-completeness audit.
- A recurrence-rule engine (recurrence = the "log the next one" workflow on the event;
  `reminder_date` is the only future-dated field).
- Photo galleries / a Photos tab / per-record image thumbnails on dogs & litters.
  (Filed documents and expense receipts **do** store files — the `files`-table PDFs
  behind Documents and `expenses.receipt_file_id`, §26.1 — and `Kennel.logo_data_url`
  is still the one inline image field, §4; there is no general per-record photo store
  beyond those.)
- Pairing/litter-subject events in the CSV importer (dog-subject only).

---

## 16. Invariants checklist (before you commit)

1. **Layering:** no page imports `db.js` or calls `db.*`; no page touches `localStorage`
   (go through a repo / `settings.js`).
2. **One canonical direction:** you added a query for a reverse relationship, not a mirror
   field.
3. **New FK ⇒ registry line** in `referenceRegistry.js`.
4. **Escaping:** every user value in hand-built innerHTML is `esc()`'d; `listView` `cell`
   functions escape; `reportView` `value` functions return plain text.
5. **New/renamed/removed/edited app file ⇒ update `sw.js` `PRECACHE_URLS` **and** bump
   `CACHE_NAME`.** Sanity check:
   ```bash
   # from KennelOS/ — lists any app file missing from the precache, and any
   # precache entry with no file on disk. Both lists should be empty.
   python3 - <<'PY'
   import re, os
   sw = open('sw.js').read()
   urls = re.findall(r"'([^']+)'", sw.split('PRECACHE_URLS')[1].split(']')[0])
   real = [os.path.join(r,f).replace('./','') for r,_,fs in os.walk('.') for f in fs
           if f.endswith(('.js','.html','.css')) and '/vendor' not in r]
   print("missing from precache:", sorted(set(real)-set(urls)-{'sw.js'}) or "OK")
   print("listed but absent   :", [u for u in urls if u!='./' and not os.path.exists(u)] or "OK")
   PY
   ```
6. **Schema:** pre-first-release you may edit `version(1)`; after real data ships, additive
   `version(N)` blocks only, never edit a shipped block.
7. **Encoding:** source files are clean UTF-8, no BOM (matters most for files with
   user-facing strings like `csvImport.js`).
8. `node --check <file>.js` parses everything you touched (no bundler to catch it).

---

## 17. Local development

```bash
cd KennelOS
python3 -m http.server 8000      # or: npx serve
# open http://localhost:8000/  — never file://
```

There is no build, no test runner, and no linter wired in. Verification is: `node --check`
for syntax, serving locally and exercising the flow in a browser, and the precache sanity
check above. State resets via **Reset App to Start** (or clearing site data); sample data is
seeded by taking the first-run **guided tour** ("Show me around!"), or restored from a JSON
backup via Import/Export.

---

## 18. Common maintenance recipes

**Add a field to an existing entity** — add it to the entity's form/detail page and (if
you'll query/filter/sort on it) to that table's index string in `db.js`. Plain persisted
fields need no schema change. Add validation to the repo only if it's a hard rule. If it's
an FK, add a `referenceRegistry.js` line. Update CSV mapping + sample data if relevant.

**Add an event type** — add one entry to `EVENT_TYPES` in `vocab.js` (`value`, `label`,
`badge`, `subjects`, `duration`, `fields`, and `relatedContact` if it needs a contact FK).
The event form, timeline, badges, and (for dog-subject types) the event importer pick it up
automatically.

**Add a report** — build a page that loads records and calls `createReportView` with
`columns` (`value` returns text), `filters`, `search`, and `csvFilename`; link it from
`pages/reports.html`. Add the new page to `sw.js` (recipe §16.5).

**Add a new entity** — new `db.js` table (new version block if post-release), new
`<entity>Repo.js` via `makeRepo` with a validator, a `referenceRegistry.js` array (and lines
wherever it's referenced), list/detail pages, a CSV mapping if it imports, nav wiring if it
deserves a hub, sample-data coverage, and `sw.js` precache entries. Build order: schema →
repo → list/detail → events/relationships → completeness features.

**Add a new page** — always finish by adding it to `sw.js` `PRECACHE_URLS` and bumping
`CACHE_NAME`, or it won't work offline.

## 19. Derived nudges & the away-board union

Two small `data/` modules sit on top of the repos as pure composition — neither owns storage
beyond the one localStorage ledger below.

**`data/nudges.js`** — `computeNudges()` reads current record state ONLY (no ledger
awareness) and returns zero or more:
```
{ key, title, detail, subjectHref, actions: [{ label, run: async () => {} }] }
```
Eight rules, each producing its own stable `key` so a dismissal survives re-computation:
- **Stud-service status** — `sent_date` passed + `status='arranged'` → suggest
  `in_progress`; `returned_date` passed + `status ∈ {arranged, in_progress}` → suggest
  `completed` (never both; completed wins if both hold).
- **Promote-lifecycle** — opt-in per kennel (`Kennel.promote_nudge_enabled`): a
  `status='puppy'`, `disposition='keeping'` dog past its kennel's
  `promote_age_male_months`/`promote_age_female_months` (by sex) gets a "promote to active
  breeding?" suggestion. No kennel, disabled, or non-`keeping` disposition ⇒ silent —
  decide-not-auto-promote, never a mutation on its own.
- **Stud → pairing** — a stud service that's `completed` or overdue-returned with no
  `pairing_id` yet suggests creating one, deep-linking to
  `pairing.html?new=1&stud_service=<id>`. Auto-dismisses: once `pairing_id` is set the rule
  produces nothing — the link is the done-signal, no ledger entry needed.
- **Heat → pairing** — a concluded `heat_cycle` event (`event_end_date < today`) with no
  live pairing recorded for that dam since the heat started suggests creating one via
  `pairing.html?new=1&dam=<dogId>`.
- **Overdue pairing** — a pairing in a pre-whelp status
  (`planned`/`bred`/`confirmed_pregnant`) whose `expected_due_date` has passed, with no
  litter recorded against it (`litterRepo.getForPairing`), suggests either fix: mark the
  pairing `whelped` directly, or deep-link to `litter.html?new=1&pairing=<id>`.
- **Litter → sold** — a non-archived `ready` litter whose whole roster is resolved to
  `placed`/`keeping`, with **at least one** actually `placed` (an all-`keeping` litter sold
  nothing, so it never fires), suggests marking the litter `sold`.
- **Litter → reopen** — a `sold` or `closed` litter with any puppy back to `available`
  suggests reopening it to `ready`.
- **Litter → close** — a `sold` litter with no `available` puppy where **every** `placed`
  puppy has a `delivered` sale suggests marking it `closed`. A placed puppy with no delivered
  sale — including one with no sale row at all — blocks the nudge.

The three litter-lifecycle rules are aggregate facts over a litter's derived roster (and, for
close, its sales), so `computeNudges()` groups the already-loaded `dogRepo.getAll()` result by
`litter_id` in one pass and adds `saleRepo.getAll()` to its parallel load rather than
re-scanning per record. Their actions mutate only `Litter.status` via `litterRepo.update`;
nothing auto-mutates. The stud→pairing and heat→pairing rules share one dedup helper
(`pairingExistsForDam`): a pairing counts as "already handled" if it's for the same dam, not
`cancelled`/`failed`, and opened (`planned_date`, falling back to `created_at`) on or after
the window in question.

**`data/nudgeState.js`** — the dismissal ledger (§11): `isDismissed`, `dismiss`, `clearAll`.
A computed nudge has no backing row to persist "dismissed" on, so dismissal is device-local UI
state, deliberately kept **out of** JSON backups.

**Rendering (`pages/today.js`)** owns the split: it calls `computeNudges()`, filters out
`isDismissed(key)` itself, renders what's left in a "Nudges" section (above Reminders), wires
each nudge's own action button(s), and adds one generic "Dismiss" button per row — the same
mechanism for every nudge, owned by the renderer.

**`data/awayBoard.js`** — `getAwayBoardRows()` unions two sources into one normalized
view-model (`{ dogId, location, reason, contactId, outDate, returnDate, dropoffTime,
pickupTime, sourceType, sourceId, href }`): `eventRepo.getBoardRows()` (boarding events) plus
`studServiceRepo.getBoardRows()` (stud services where `type='in_person'` and today falls in
`[sent_date, returned_date]`, open-ended if `returned_date` is null; away dog is always
`our_dog_id`; location resolves from the partner contact's `address`). Consumed by
`pages/board.js`, `pages/today.js` (`renderBoard`), and `pages/dashboard.js` (the away-count
tile). Boarding events still cover non-stud reasons (grow-out, foster, owner travel); a
stud-reason stay is authored on the StudService record itself, not duplicated as a boarding
event.

`StudService.type` and the three `Kennel` nudge fields are plain unindexed fields (§5); the
stud→pairing nudge action reuses the existing `StudService.pairing_id` link. No schema, index,
or reference-registry change.

---

## 20. Companion share-out (buyers & partners)

A **one-way, point-in-time export** of a curated slice of a recipient's own data, delivered as
a **no-account, read-only link** — not sync, not a login, not a live view. The main app stays
single-user/offline/all-local; this adds *recipients*.

### What it is

**Three bundle types**, all **anchored on a Contact** (the recipient) and discriminated by
`bundleType`:

- **`prospective`** — a prospective family (a client/waitlister with no sale): current
  availability as **one card per litter with its available pups nested inside** (`litters[]`,
  each with `nickname`, `breed`, `whelpDate`, `acceptDepositsDate` (from
  `Litter.accept_deposits_date`, rendered between "Born" and "Estimated ready" only when
  set), `readyDate`, a `dogCard` for `sire`/`dam`, and `pups[]`). Each pup carries `sex`,
  `callName`, `markings`, and its **sex-keyed list `price` + `deposit`**
  (`Litter.expected_price_*`/`expected_deposit_*`). The availability is the same for every
  prospect — **no per-recipient private data**.
- **`family`** — a current family (a buyer with an **open** sale per `saleRepo.isOpenSale`):
  **one rich card per placed pup** (`pups[]`, from `saleRepo.getByBuyer` filtered by
  `isOpenSale` → dog — terminal sales `delivered`/`returned`/`cancelled` never appear,
  matching membership). Each pup carries `callName`, `sex`, `photosUrl` (`Dog.url`),
  `litterNickname` (when set), `sire`/`dam` (call + registered name), a **computed `age`
  `{ageWeeks, ageDays}`** as-of the generation date (**never the raw DOB**), a `placement`
  block or an `estimatedReadyDate`, sale facts (`placementType`/`saleStatus` sent as raw
  values, the shell maps them to their proper-cased vocab labels; `price`, `deposit`,
  `transportFee` (shown only when present), `deferredPickup` (shown only when a
  `deferred_boarding_amount` is present — `{total, amount, frequency, duration}`, where
  `total = amount × count`; the shell shows the total with the rate breakdown beneath it), a
  **computed** `remainingBalance` = `price + transportFee + deferredPickup.total − deposit`
  (absent parts count as 0; never stored), and `balanceDueDate` (`Sale.balance_due_date`)),
  and an `eventSections[]` **curated per-type event history**. When the sale carries a
  **complete** deferred pickup (amount + frequency + duration) a `deferred_pickup_boarding`
  section is **pinned to the top** of `eventSections`, listing the dog's `boarding` events as
  `{startDate, endDate}` scheduled ranges (only the two dates copied — never boarding notes).
  Plus top-level `contracts[]` = the sale's non-archived contracts as `{signedDate,
  documentUrl}` (shell shows the signed date or "Not Signed" + a "View/sign contract here"
  link). Event history
  surfaces a **title + one curated safe field per type** — `vaccination`→`vaccine`,
  `preventative`→`product`, `weight_check`→weight, `milestone`→`description`, `note`→title
  only — **never** the freeform top-level `notes`, and **never** illness/injury/evaluation or
  any type not on that list.
- **`partner`** — a stud/lease/co-own partner: `studServices` (labeled **Stud/Dam `dogCard`
  blocks** carrying registered/call name + completed tests, each followed by an **Agreement
  Details** section — the service `type` (`in_person`/`ai`, proper-cased), `sentDate`/
  `returnedDate` relabeled **Begins/Ends**, `fee_structure` as **Terms**, plus the
  native-decimal `fee_amount` when the structure includes a flat fee and the `pick_status`
  when it includes a pick of litter — and a **Contract** section carrying the service's own
  governing/most-recent contract as `contract` = `{signedDate, documentUrl}`), and the
  top-level `contracts` (lease/co_own/other contracts where `related_contact_id` = them). Each
  is **projected per type** by `projectContract()`: all carry `type`, `title`, `status`,
  `signedDate` (shown "Not Signed" when null), `terms`, and `document_url`; a **`lease`** also
  carries `startDate`/`endDate` and `dog` (the leased dog as `dogRef` = `{registeredName,
  callName}`); a **`co_own`** also carries `dog`. The shell titles the card by type when it
  holds a single type ("Lease agreement" / "Co-ownership"), else "Contracts". These are
  reduced to the **live contract per distinct agreement, not the full history**: only
  `contractRepo.isLivePartnerContract(c, today)` contracts survive, grouped by
  `(contract_type, related_dog_id)`, and each group collapses to `governingContract()` (most
  recent signed) or the most-recent-by-`created_at` fallback. The **same
  `isLivePartnerContract` predicate drives partner membership** in `companion.js`, so who
  appears and what their bundle shows can't drift.
- **`dogCard` / completed tests** (shared projection): prospective sire/dam and partner
  stud/dam use `dogCard(dog)` → `{registeredName, callName, photosUrl, tests}`, where `tests`
  is `completedTests(dogId)` reading `eventRepo.getForSubject('dog', …)` and projecting
  `breed_specific_test` (`test_name`:`result`), `ofa_pennhip` (`joint`:`rating`), and
  `genetic_test` (`panel_name`:`result`) **only when the result/rating is non-empty** (else
  `[]`, block omitted).

### Console — one package type at a time

The **Companion Messaging console** (`pages/companion.*`, in the "More" menu) is scoped by
`?type=` seg-tabs — one per `COMPANION_TYPES` value (Prospective families / Current families /
Partners), the same URL-param tab pattern as the Contacts group tabs; no param defaults to the
first type. The active tab drives the whole page: the single template card shown, a
plain-language **filter blurb** above it, the **recipients list** (only contacts that match
the type), and the bundle type "Prepare link" builds (there is no per-row type picker — the
tab **is** the type).

Each recipient row is **collapsed by default** to a one-line header (name + a `note` badge
when `companion_note` is set + email/phone); clicking the header reveals the note editor, Save
note / Preview / Prepare link actions, and the built link. **Preview** builds the same bundle
"Prepare link" would (persisting any unsaved note first) and opens a modal showing the channel
body text plus the real `companion-view.html` shell loaded in an iframe off that bundle's hash
— a byte-for-byte render of what the recipient will see, sending nothing. Both actions share
`buildSendArtifacts`, so the preview can never drift from the send.

**Membership predicates** (`companion.js`): a **prospective** is a Contact with
`waitlist_status === 'active'`; a **family** is a buyer with an **open** sale per
`saleRepo.isOpenSale(s)`; a **partner** is a Contact who is the `partner_contact_id` on a
non-archived StudService whose `returned_date` is empty or `>= today`, **or** the
`related_contact_id` on a `lease`/`co_own`/`other` contract that is live per
`contractRepo.isLivePartnerContract(c, today)`. A Contact can appear under more than one tab —
that's expected. The prospective filter is display-only, but the **family** and **partner**
predicates are shared with the bundle builder, so membership and bundle contents stay in
lockstep.

### Two-layer messaging

Layer 1 is per-type config (`kennelName`/`tagline`/`introText`/`announcement`/`closer`, plus
the `include` component map — below) in `settings.js` under the `companion` key, edited in the
console's template card. Layer 2 is **`Contact.companion_note`**, a per-recipient personal
line. Both are carried in the bundle **separately** — `announcement` (broadcast) and
`personalNote` (the note) — and the shell shows them **alongside each other**. The shell
**prepends the recipient's name** to the intro text ("Hi {name} — …"; there is no separate
greeting card), renders the personal note in the header card's accent box, the broadcast
announcement as its own card beneath, and the `closer` sign-off as the final card **just above
the snapshot date**. The bundle copies the resolved copy inline, so header/landing text updates
without a shell deploy.

### Per-type component allow-list (`include`)

A third piece of Layer-1 config: a flat map of boolean flags, one set per bundle type, stored
under `companion[type].include` and edited as the "What to include" checkboxes in each template
card. **All flags default `true`** — everything shows — and `getCompanionSettings` deep-merges
the map over the defaults so a flag the owner never set (or one added in a later version) falls
back to on, never silently hiding a component. Each builder reads its type's `include` and
**only ever subtracts**: a disabled component's field is emitted `null`/`''`/`[]` (or the
section is skipped), never a new key — so the allow-list invariant below is untouched and no
`COMPANION_BUNDLE_VERSION` bump is needed. **Master/child flags:** a master gates a group
(`parents`, `pricing`, `studServices`) and the builder ANDs each child with its master, so a
child only emits when both are on; the console greys out a child whose master is unchecked.

The flags, by type:
- **prospective:** `parents` (→ `parentRegisteredName`, `parentCallName`, `parentPhotos`,
  `parentTests`), `pricing` (→ `pricingPrice`, `pricingDeposit`), `litterDates` (born /
  accept-deposits / estimated-ready), `markings`, `fosterOwnerKennel` (the litter card's
  `breederKennel` — the foster dam's **owner kennel**, §25; emitted only for a foster litter,
  empty for every ordinary litter regardless of the flag). When every `dogCard` field is off the
  card is omitted entirely; when no pup carries a price/deposit the shell drops the deposit
  disclaimer.
- **family:** `age`, `parentage`, `photos`, `readyPlacement`, `financials` (price, deposit,
  transport, deferred-pickup, remaining balance, balance-due — **not** placement type / sale
  status, which always show), the five history flags `histVaccination`/`histPreventative`/
  `histWeight`/`histMilestone`/`histNote`, `histBoarding` (deferred-pickup boarding section),
  `contract`, `fosterOwnerKennel` (the pup card's `breederKennel` — the owner kennel of a
  pup that came from a foster litter, §25; empty otherwise).
- **partner:** `studServices` (master → `studRegisteredName`, `studCallName`, `studPhotos`,
  `studTests` for the Stud/Dam cards, plus `studAgreement` for the Agreement Details/
  compensation and `studContract` for the per-service contract), and top-level `contracts`
  (lease / co-own / other).

### The load-bearing invariant: the allow-list builder

`data/companionExport.js` is the **security spine**. `importExport.js` deliberately iterates
whatever tables exist (a full backup); this builder does the **exact opposite**:
`buildProspectiveBundle`/`buildFamilyBundle`/`buildPartnerBundle(contact)` each **construct a
fresh object naming every field explicitly**, reading through repos (never `db.*`), copying
**only** listed fields — **no record spread, no filter-over-a-record**. After building,
`assertOnlyKeys()` runs a **positive** allow-list check and **aborts the send** if any
unexpected top-level key is present. A new field added to a source table does **not** appear in
a bundle until someone adds it here by name — including fields nested inside a pup/litter/
service, safe only because each is copied by name and the **top-level** `*_KEYS` allow-lists
stay exact. Money is limited to the recipient's **own** figures: a prospect sees the litter's
per-sex list price/deposit, a family sees their own sale price/deposit/balance, a partner sees
the one stud `fee_amount`.

### Transport & the shell

- The bundle rides the **URL fragment**: `JSON.stringify` → **lz-string**
  (`vendor/lz-string.min.mjs`, vendored + version-locked, v1.5.0) →
  `companion-view.html#<hash>`. Send is a **real `sms:`/`mailto:` anchor** the user taps (their
  tap is the activating gesture — never a post-async `window.location` assignment). **Channel
  by size:** email is the default; SMS is blocked above `MAX_SMS_HASH_LEN` and steered to
  email; email warns above `MAX_EMAIL_HASH_LEN` (the console's `prepareLink`).
- **`companion-view.html`** is the recipient shell — one self-contained, read-only static file
  at the app root (inlined, version-locked lz-string; branches on `bundleType` and
  `bundleVersion`; **tolerates additive fields**; theme-aware; shows a prominent "snapshot as
  of" line). It is **infrastructure**: it must stay **backward-compatible with every
  `bundleVersion` ever sent** — bundle evolution is additive, `bundleVersion` bumps only on a
  breaking shape change, and a shell fix must not break links sent last month.

### No revocation / no expiry

A hash-link, once sent, is permanent. The sensitive document is **never in the hash** — only
`document_url`, a pointer; access is governed by the owner's Drive sharing, which they revoke
independently. `updatedAt` renders prominently so a stale link is self-evident.

### Model touch-points (all covered in §4/§5/§7)

`Contract.related_contact_id` (indexed FK, `CONTACT_REFERENCES`, `getByContact`),
`Contract.document_url`, `StudService.pick_status`, `Contact.companion_note` — the last three
plain/unindexed. `companionExport.js` and the console/shell are pure composition + projection;
no two-way pointers, every reverse stays a query.

## 21. Financials — income & the Expense ledger

The Financials hub has **three views**, switched by a top toggle
(`financials.html?view=overview|income|expenses`; a bare URL opens Overview, a `?bucket=` link
still opens Expenses):

- **Expenses** — the Expense ledger (money spent).
- **Income** — a **derived** view of money coming in, sectioned earned vs anticipated.
- **Overview** — Earned income / Anticipated income / Total expenses / **Net (earned − spent)**
  tiles, plus a component breakdown of income beside a category breakdown of expenses.

### The Expense ledger (money spent)

The single home for money spent. One `expenses` table (§4/§5), polymorphic like Event:
`subject_type ∈ {dog, litter, pairing, kennel}` + `subject_id`. Kennel-wide overhead (facility,
bulk food, registration dues, marketing) lives on `subject_type='kennel'`; there is deliberately
**no `general` subject** — program overhead is logged against your own kennel, so there is never
a null `subject_id`. Revenue is **not stored** here (it stays on `Sale.price`/`deposit_amount`
and `StudService.fee_amount`); this table is costs only.

**Foster compensation & reimbursables (§25).** A foster litter needs no new income
machinery: whoever holds the puppies books the gross Sales, and the **other party's cut is a
real Expense** — the `foster_split` category ("Foster compensation", whether the terms are a %
split or a flat per-pup fee) — so it flows into the
Litter P&L as cost like any other spend. Owner-reimbursable rearing costs use the ledger's
`reimbursable`/`reimbursed_date` fields: `litterFinances.js` **excludes a reimbursed
reimbursable from your cost** (it washes out — someone paid you back) and tallies a
**still-pending** one as an outstanding receivable (`reimbursablePending`, the report's "Owed
back" column) while leaving it in cost until settled.

The ledger has a **CSV import path** (the `expense` mapping in `csvImport.js`, reached from
Import/Export → "Import expenses (CSV)"), so a companion receipts/mileage app — or any
spreadsheet — can feed it with the standard dry-run + match-or-create preview. See §9 for the
mapping (columns, subject resolution, mileage derivation, idempotent natural key). No photo
crosses over on import — to attach a receipt image to a ledger row, use the in-app receipt
capture on the expense form (§26.1).

### Mileage / transport costs

A cost you drive for (vet runs, delivering a puppy, hauling a dam to a stud) is captured as a
**mileage expense** — a normal ledger row whose dollar `amount` is **derived** from distance,
not typed. The add-expense form (both `assets/expensePanel.js` on every subject page and the
Financials hub's own modal in `financials.js`) carries a **Flat amount ↔ Mileage** toggle:
Mileage mode swaps the Amount box for **Miles** + **Rate / mile** (the rate prefilled from
`settings.getMileageDefaults()`, with a "Save this rate as my default" opt-in via
`setMileageDefaults`), shows a live `= $X (N mi × $R/mi)` preview, and locks the category to the
dedicated **`mileage`** ("Mileage / travel") `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` value.

The math is a **repo rule, not a UI one**: `expenseRepo.normalize` computes `amount =
round(miles × mileage_rate, 2)` whenever `miles` is set (and stores `miles`/`mileage_rate` as
plain unindexed fields), so the amount is authoritative regardless of which modal — or a future
CSV/import — writes it; `validateExpense` requires a non-negative rate on any mileage entry, and
`create` normalizes **before** validating so the derived amount exists to check. A flat expense
leaves both fields null and keeps its entered amount. The pure helper `mileageAmount(miles,
rate)` is exported for the form's live preview so preview and stored value can't drift. Because
`mileage` is a real category, driving costs break out on their own Expenses seg-tab and in the
Overview category breakdown automatically (the seg-tabs are built from the vocab, never
hand-listed) — a clean deductible-mileage total. The two form modals share
`buildMileageFields`/`wireMileageMode` (exported from `expensePanel.js`) so they never diverge.
No new table, index, FK, or `referenceRegistry` entry — the fields are plain and the amount is
derived.

Buying a new dog is deliberately an **expense, never a Sale** — `Sale` and `StudService` stay
strictly income-side records (owner decision). `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` carries a `dog_purchase`
("New dog purchase") category; the dog's own `acquisition` event type (dog-subject, instant,
`source` field for the seller) is an **option** on that dog's timeline, never auto-created, and
its default Cost category (`defaultExpenseCategoryFor`) is `dog_purchase` — logging one with a
Cost amount upserts the linked `Expense` the normal event↔cost way.

### The event↔cost link (one canonical direction)

`Expense.event_id` is the **only** stored link between an event and its cost:

- **Event form → ledger.** The event form's "Cost" (+ "Cost category") field is a convenience
  writer: on save (`assets/eventForm.js`) it upserts an `Expense` carrying `event_id` = the
  saved event and the event's own subject; clearing the Cost hard-deletes that linked expense.
  Cascade (litter-wide) events create one linked expense per created event. Event stores **no
  `cost` field**. The Cost category dropdown pre-selects `defaultExpenseCategoryFor(event_type)`
  (overridable before save). `veterinary` is reserved for genuine clinical vet care
  (`vaccination`, `illness`, `injury`, `surgery`, `vet_visit`, `ultrasound`) — **not** a catch-all;
  diagnostic panels (`genetic_test`/`ofa_pennhip`/`breed_specific_test`/`progesterone_test`) map to
  `testing`, `boarding`→`boarding`, `acquisition`→`dog_purchase`, and everything else (including
  stockable products like `medication`/`preventative` and observation-only events like
  `abnormalities`) falls through to `other`.
- **Ledger → event (display).** `timeline.js` reads amounts back via `expenseRepo.getByEvent`
  and shows a `🔗 event` tag on linked ledger rows.
- **Ledger → event (create).** In `assets/expensePanel.js`, a dog/litter/pairing expense with
  no `event_id` offers "Log event →": it opens the event form for that subject and, on save,
  back-fills the new event's id onto the expense. No mirror field — the reverse is always the
  `getByEvent` query.

### Income (derived — `data/incomeView.js`)

There is **no income table and no `is_earned` field.** `data/incomeView.js` is a read-only
aggregator: it reads the Sale table and the **outgoing** StudService table — the only two places
money-in is recorded — and normalizes each into one view-model row per record, classifying every
money component as **earned** or **anticipated** on each load. Storing this (or a mirror flag)
would be a forbidden stored back-pointer (§7); it is always recomputed.

Classification (owner decisions):

- **Sale.** `price` splits into a deposit portion (`deposit_amount`) and a balance portion
  (`price − deposit`); `transport_fee` and deferred-pickup boarding (`deferred_boarding_amount ×
  count`, the count in `deferred_boarding_duration_days`) ride with the balance. A component is
  **earned** once its paid-date is recorded (`deposit_date` / `balance_paid_date`) or the status
  has advanced past it (`deposit_paid`/`paid_in_full`/`delivered`), else **anticipated**. On a
  **returned/cancelled** sale only amounts already recorded as paid survive (as earned); the
  unpaid remainder is dropped, never anticipated. A part-paid open sale therefore appears in
  **both** the Earned and Anticipated boxes, each with its own portion.
- **StudService (outgoing only** — incoming is money *we* pay, an expense). `fee_amount` is
  **earned** when `completed`, **anticipated** while `arranged`/`in_progress`, dropped when
  `failed`/`cancelled`. `pick_value_amount` is a **non-cash estimate**, surfaced on its own
  `pick` line and kept **out** of the earned/anticipated cash totals and the Net figure.

Vocabs (`vocab.js`): `INCOME_STATES` (earned/anticipated badges), `INCOME_SOURCE_TYPES`
(sale/stud badges), `INCOME_COMPONENTS` (deposit/balance/transport/boarding/stud_fee/pick — the
summary's per-component breakdown, mirroring the expense category one).

Income surfaces (`pages/financials.js`): the Income view shows a summary card
(earned/anticipated totals + component breakdown) then **two grouped boxes** — **Earned** and
**Anticipated** — each a `reportView` table (one row per sale/stud, source/year filters, CSV
export). Clicking a row opens a compact **Adjust** modal that writes the money/status/paid-date
fields straight back through `saleRepo.update` / `studServiceRepo.update` (with an **Open full
record →** link), so an anticipated amount can be flipped to earned from the hub. No new FK,
table, or `referenceRegistry` entry — income is purely derived.

**Per-litter income** (sales reach a litter via the puppy's `dog.litter_id`): the **Litter
detail page** has a deliberately simple "Sales & Income" panel — each puppy sale's **total
value** (`price + transport + deferred boarding`) and status, with a total, and **no**
earned/anticipated split or net (owner decision — that detail lives only on the report). The
**Litter P&L report** (`litter-finances-report`, `data/litterFinances.js`) is the full picture:
earned/anticipated income vs the litter's own expenses **plus** each puppy's dog-subject
expenses, and the net.

### Surfaces

- **`assets/expensePanel.js`** — the reusable per-subject ledger panel (running total,
  add/edit/archive/delete, its own add-expense modal). Mounted on the dog, litter, pairing, and
  **kennel** detail pages (the last via `pages/kennel.*`, reached from the Kennels list's
  "Open →").
- **`pages/financials.*`** — the **Financials hub** (its own top-level nav tab, not a report),
  with the **Overview / Income / Expenses** top toggle. The **"+ Add Expense"** button (logs a
  cost against any dog / litter / pairing / kennel) shows only on the Expenses view.
  - **Expenses view:** a summary card (grand total + per-category breakdown) over the standard
    `reportView` ledger table (category/subject-type/year filters + CSV export). **Sectioned by
    category:** a `seg-tabs` row built from `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` (never hand-listed), one tab per
    category via `financials.html?view=expenses&bucket=<value>` pre-filtering the loaded ledger,
    plus **All** (default, no `bucket`). The ledger loads newest-to-oldest by `expense_date`
    before any bucket filter.
  - **Income view:** summary card + two grouped Earned/Anticipated `reportView` boxes with the
    row-level Adjust modal.
  - **Overview view:** the Net tiles + income/expense breakdown.

### Safety

- **Companion export is safe by construction** — `companionExport.js` is a positive allow-list
  (§20), so `expenses` never appears in any bundle. Financials do not leak.
- **Hard-delete guards** (§7): an event with a linked expense, and a subject with any expense,
  are archive-only until the expense is removed.

## 22. Referral tracking (Sale / StudService "Referred by")

`Sale.referred_by_contact_id` and `StudService.referred_by_contact_id` are indexed FKs → Contact
(§4/§5), guarded in `CONTACT_REFERENCES`. Each page's form has a "Referred by" picker (any
contact; the stud page uses a general picker, not its breeder-only partner one). On save the repo
calls `contactRepo.ensureType` to auto-tag the referrer with the `buyer_referrer` /
`stud_referrer` role (`CONTACT_TYPE` vocab). The tag is a convenience label; the canonical link
stays the FK on the Sale/StudService, and a contact's referrals are the reverse query over the
indexed FK.

---

## 23. Puppy Record (print-only PDF)

`pages/puppy-record.html`/`.js` (`?sale=<id>`) is a printable, one-page-style record for a puppy
being sold: puppy info, sire/dam (with their genetic + breed-specific test results as a
pipe-separated line), a **Health History** grid — one card per health-relevant event type
(`vaccination`, `preventative`, `genetic_test`, `ofa_pennhip`, `breed_specific_test`, `illness`,
`medication`, `surgery`, `vet_visit`, `injury`, `abnormalities`, `weight_check` — deliberately
excludes admin/lifecycle types like `milestone`/`placement`/`note`) — and the buyer's contact
info off the Sale. Every row is omitted (not shown as a blank/"—") when its field is empty. Reads
only, through `saleRepo`/`dogRepo`/`contactRepo`/`litterRepo`/`eventRepo` (layering rule, §2) — no
new repo or table.

**"Download" is the browser's own Print → Save as PDF** (`window.print()`, gated by an `@media
print` block that hides nav/back/print-button), not a vendored PDF library. Entry points: a
"Puppy Record (PDF)" button on `sale.js`'s header actions, and a "Print Puppy Record" button on
`sales.js` that opens a modal — a dropdown of every **non-delivered** sale (`status !==
'delivered'`), ordered by dog name, buyer name shown alongside for disambiguation — whose Print
button opens the record in a new tab with `?autoprint=1`, which triggers `window.print()` itself
once rendered.

The header also renders the resolving own-kennel's `logo_data_url` (§24) above the kennel name
when one is set.

---

## 24. Invoice & Receipt (print-only PDF)

`pages/invoice.html`/`.js` (`?source=sale|stud&id=<id>&doc=invoice|receipt&cfg=<json>`) is a
printable one-page financial document for a single income record, covering **all five cash income
types** — **Deposit, Remaining Purchase Price, Transport Fee, Boarding Fee** (the four Sale
components) and **Stud Fee** (the outgoing StudService component; customer-facing labels from
`INVOICE_LINE_LABELS`, distinct from the Financials-view `INCOME_COMPONENTS` labels). Non-cash
`pick` value is never billable, so it never appears. Reads only, through
`saleRepo`/`studServiceRepo`/`dogRepo`/`contactRepo`/`litterRepo`/`kennelRepo` (layering rule §2)
— no new repo or table. "Download" is the browser's own **Print → Save as PDF** (`window.print()`,
gated by an `@media print` block), same posture as the Puppy Record.

- **Line base amounts** come from `incomeView.incomeLineItems(source, record)` (§6/§21), so the
  document can never show a component the Income view wouldn't classify. The per-line **choices**
  ride the `cfg` param (a compact URL-encoded JSON the generator modal builds): each included line
  carries `{ key, mode: 'full'|'partial', collected, dueDate }`.
- **Full vs Partial** (per line, owner's model): **Partial** prints "<Name> (partial)" with the
  entered `collected` as its amount; **Full** prints the record's full base amount, and
  `collected` is treated as *already collected* — on an **invoice** it is subtracted in the totals
  (Subtotal → "Less amount already collected" → **Balance**), on a **receipt** the line shows the
  remaining `base − collected`, the collected figure is not printed, and the label reads "<Name>
  **(balance)**". There is no payment ledger, so `collected` defaults to 0 for manual entry.
- **Invoice specifics:** no Paid/Due status column; a per-line **Due by** date (the modal prefills
  the *soonest* of the sale's `balance_due_date` and any scheduled `placement` event date for the
  puppy, still editable per line) — **except Deposit, whose Due by is always "Immediately"**, so
  the modal shows a static "Due immediately" note for that line instead of a date picker; footnote
  markers on **sale** invoices (`*` on Deposit, `**` on Remaining Purchase Price / Transport /
  Boarding — stud fees carry neither) render the two standing disclaimers (deposit
  non-refundability; balance-due-date basis) in the footer; the payment block reads **"Payment may
  be made using one of the following methods:"** over a checkbox-style list of the **accepted
  methods** — a global default in `settings.getInvoiceDefaults().acceptedMethods`, editable per
  document in the modal (checkbox set from `PAYMENT_METHODS`) with a **Save as my default** button
  (`setInvoiceDefaults`).
- **Receipt specifics:** keeps the **Payment received** box (method used / reference / date) and
  stamps **Paid**; totals "Total paid".
- **Issuer** is the resolving own kennel (`dog.kennel_id` if own, else the first own kennel — the
  Puppy Record fallback), with its `logo_data_url`, `location`, `website`, and the owner Contact's
  name/email/phone (via `getMyContactId`). **Recipient** is the sale's buyer or the stud partner
  contact. A document number defaults to a stable `INV-/RCT-<yyyymmdd>-<id>` when `invoice_number`
  is blank.
- **Persisted fields** (`invoice_number`, `invoice_notes`, and — for receipts —
  `payment_method`/`payment_reference`, §4) are written on the Sale / StudService by the generator
  modal so they prefill next time and ride backups. Everything else (Full/Partial, collected, due
  dates, accepted methods) is per-generation and rides `cfg` / `settings`. Nothing here is a new
  FK, table, or `referenceRegistry` entry — the fields are plain and the document is pure
  projection.

The generator modal lives on the Financials hub (`financials.js`, the "Invoice / Receipt" button
on every view), lists every income record (from `getIncomeRows`), and opens the print page in a new
tab. Because the record is persisted (an `await`) before navigating, the tab is opened **blank and
synchronously within the click handler** and only navigated afterward — opening it *after* the
await would let iOS Safari's pop-up blocker silently swallow it (the gesture is spent), so the
invoice/receipt would never appear on iPhone. The document **never prints itself** — the owner
triggers the browser's Print → Save as PDF with the page's "Print / Save as PDF" button.

## 25. Foster whelps (foster-in & foster-out)

Tracking a litter whelped/raised under a **caretaker↔owner arrangement** where the two parties
differ, with a contract and an income split. `foster_partner_contact_id` is indexed in the
collapsed `version(1)` block so the referential guard can protect the foster partner Contact
(§5).

### The two settling ideas

- **Foster is a per-litter fact, not a dog fact.** The same dam can have more than one foster
  litter (and non-foster litters), so foster lives on the **Litter** (`foster_direction` +
  `foster_partner_contact_id` + split terms), never on the Dog. A foster **puppy** is an ordinary
  `status='puppy'` Dog we manage and sell; its foster-ness is a **derived** read of its litter's
  `foster_direction` (badge only) — it is emphatically **not** an `external`/`external_reference`
  dog (that is a reference-only record we don't raise). The reverse of "is this puppy fostered?"
  is a query over the litter, per the one-canonical-direction rule (§4.2).
- **Whoever holds the puppies books the Sales; the other party's cut is an Expense.** Direction
  only decides who holds the Sales:
  - **foster-in** — an external dam's litter is raised in our care → **we** record the puppy
    Sales (full gross) and pay the **owner's** split out as a `foster_split` Expense;
  - **foster-out** — our dam's litter is raised elsewhere → the pups are still our Dog records; if
    we handle placement we record the Sales and pay the **caretaker's** cut as a `foster_split`
    Expense (identical shape, roles swapped).

  This is why foster needs **no new income machinery** — it rides the existing Sale → derived
  income path (§21), and the split-payout is a normal cost, exactly like an incoming stud fee we
  pay. (A fully hands-off foster-out where we never see the sales — just receive a check — is the
  one gap; it is deferred, not modeled.)

  The partner's compensation is one of two models (`foster_comp_model`, owner's choice per
  litter): an **income split** (`foster_our_share_pct` + `foster_split_basis`) or a **flat fee per
  pup** (`foster_flat_fee_per_pup`). Both document the terms only — the money is the same
  `foster_split` ("Foster compensation") Expense either way, so the P&L stays model-agnostic. The
  `litter.js` edit form swaps the share-% / basis fields for a per-pup fee field as the model
  changes.

### Model touch-points (all additive; all covered in §4/§5/§7/§20/§21)

- **Litter:** `foster_direction` (plain, nullable `foster_in`/`foster_out`),
  `foster_partner_contact_id` (**indexed FK → Contact**, the one added index —
  guarded in `CONTACT_REFERENCES`), `foster_comp_model` (`income_split`/`flat_per_pup`), and
  `foster_our_share_pct`/`foster_split_basis`/`foster_flat_fee_per_pup`/`foster_split_notes`
  (plain, documentation of the compensation terms; the real payout is the Expense). `litterRepo`
  hard-checks only a known direction, a known comp model, a 0–100 share %, and a non-negative flat
  fee; everything else is warn-only in `litter.js`.
- **Vocab:** `FOSTER_DIRECTION`, `FOSTER_COMP_MODEL`, `FOSTER_SPLIT_BASIS`, a `foster`
  `CONTRACT_TYPE`, and a `foster_split` ("Foster compensation") `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` value.
- **Contract:** `foster` joins `contractRepo.DOG_LINK_TYPES`/`CONTACT_LINK_TYPES` — a foster
  contract reaches the fostered dam (`related_dog_id`) and the counterparty (`related_contact_id`)
  the same way a lease does, so **no new Contract FK**. It is also partner-facing
  (`isLivePartnerContract`), so a live foster contract confers Companion **Partner** membership.
- **Expense:** `reimbursable`/`reimbursed_date` plain fields (§21). Reimbursed costs wash out of
  the Litter P&L; pending ones surface as the "Owed back" receivable.
- **Companion (§20):** the owner/breeder **kennel** is revealed via a `breederKennel` field on
  the prospective litter card and the family pup card, sourced from the foster partner contact's
  `kennel_id`, allow-listed by name in `companionExport.js`, gated by the `fosterOwnerKennel`
  include flag, and emitted **only for a foster-IN litter** (on foster-out WE are the breeder, so
  there is nothing external to reveal; empty otherwise). `companion-view.html` renders it as a
  "Bred by" line (additive; older bundles omit it).

### Surfaces

`litter.js` (a "Foster arrangement" edit section + a read-only callout + a title badge),
`litters.js` (Foster filter + badge), `litter-finances-report.js` (Foster filter + "Owed back"
column), `expensePanel.js` (the Reimbursable toggle + Reimbursed-on date), the contract page (works
unchanged — it reads the link types from the repo), and the Companion console/shell. Sample data
seeds a full foster-in example (Meadow Ridge / Dana Ruiz: an external dam Marigold, a foster litter
with two available pups whose `breeder_kennel_id` is the owner kennel, a `foster` contract, a
`foster_split` payout, and one reimbursed + one pending reimbursable cost).

## 26. Dropbox sync & KennelAssistant

Two zero-cost, online-only features layered over the existing backup engine: **push/pull
between the owner's phones through the owner's own free Dropbox**, and **KennelAssistant**,
a deliberately tiny read-write mini-app for a junior helper's phone (log weight checks and
other events against a synced dog list — nothing else). Both are strictly opt-in buttons;
nothing syncs on its own, and the rest of the app stays fully offline-capable (§2.4).

### The Dropbox transport (`data/dropbox.js`)

- Talks straight to the Dropbox HTTP API with `fetch` — **no SDK, nothing vendored**.
- Auth is **OAuth2 + PKCE, entirely client-side** (no secret, no backend), against a
  Dropbox app registered once, by the developer, at dropbox.com/developers/apps:
  *Scoped access*, access type **App folder** (tokens can only ever see
  `/Apps/KennelOS/`), permissions `files.content.write` + `files.content.read`, and every
  connecting page's URL listed under **Redirect URIs** (`pages/import-export.html` and
  `assistant.html`, deployed + localhost variants).
- The **app key itself is hardcoded** as `APP_KEY` in `data/dropbox.js` — same pattern as
  `KennelPapers/data/dropbox.js`. This is safe because a PKCE client id is a public
  identifier, not a secret: every install shares the one key, but each user still does
  their own "Connect" and signs into their **own** Dropbox account, landing in their own
  private `/Apps/KennelOS/` folder. The key grants no access by itself, so there's no
  per-device paste step and nothing for the user to register.
- `beginDropboxAuth()` redirects out; `completeDropboxAuth()` (called on load by both
  connecting pages) finishes the `?code=` round-trip, storing a long-lived refresh token
  (`token_access_type=offline`) and minting short-lived access tokens as needed. Tokens
  live in the `dropbox` settings blob (§11); `disconnectDropbox()` forgets them. The kid's
  phone signs into the **same Dropbox account** as the owner; the app-folder scope is
  what makes that acceptable.
- `dropboxUploadJson(path, obj)` / `dropboxDownloadJson(path)` (download returns `null`
  for a file that doesn't exist yet). One 401-retry with a forced token refresh.

### The three files — one writer each (`data/assistantSync.js`)

All under the app folder, named in `DROPBOX_PATHS` (dropbox.js). **Each file has exactly
one writer**, which is what makes the scheme conflict-free — preserve that invariant:

| File | Writer | Reader | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/kennelos-backup.json` | owner (`pushToDropbox`) | owner's other phone | the full `exportAll()` backup |
| `/assistant-feed.json` | owner (`pushToDropbox`) | assistant | allow-listed dog fields + all dog-subject events |
| `/assistant-outbox.json` | assistant ("Send my updates") | owner | events the helper logged, with their own UUIDs |

- **Push** uploads backup + a freshly rebuilt feed in one act (and stamps
  `lastBackupDate`). **Pull** fetches the backup and **merge**-restores it (same upsert
  engine as file restore, §10) after a confirm showing export date + record count. The
  documented discipline: don't edit the *same record* on both phones between push and
  pull — merge is a blind per-id upsert and the pulled copy wins.
- **Privacy is enforced at feed-build time**, same posture as `companionExport.js`:
  `ASSISTANT_DOG_FIELDS` is a positive allow-list (id, call/registered name, breed, sex,
  status, DOB/DOD, color/markings, url, is_archived — **no** microchip, registration,
  ownership, parentage, prices), plus four DERIVED display fields (`litter_id` as a
  grouping key, `litter_nickname`, `sire_name`/`dam_name` as call-name copies — named
  copies, never the litters table or parentage FKs). Only `subject_type === 'dog'`
  events whose type is in **`ASSISTANT_EVENT_TYPES`** (vocab.js — currently
  `weight_check`, `milestone`, `note`, `preventative`, `medication`) ride along; the same
  list gates the assistant's log form, so what the helper sees and what they can log
  never drift. `preventative` (product/dose) and `medication` (drug/dose/frequency,
  a span — the log form's end-date field shows automatically per `duration: 'span'`)
  reuse the main app's existing field defs as-is, no assistant-side field changes
  needed. Contacts, sales,
  financials, kennels, contracts never reach the assistant device at all — that, not UI
  hiding, is the security boundary (everything client-side is inspectable).
- **Outbox import** (`fetchAssistantOutbox` → preview → `importAssistantEvents`) is the
  app's standard dry-run-then-commit posture: rows are annotated `new` / `update` /
  `no_dog` (unknown subject dog → **skipped, never invented**, per the import rule) /
  `invalid`, shown in a preview modal, then bulk-upserted by id — so re-importing the
  same outbox is a no-op. The assistant's local `pending` marker is stripped on import.

### KennelAssistant (`assistant.html` + `assistant.js` + `data/assistantStore.js`)

- Standalone shell like `companion-view.html` (no nav.js/app.js boot), but read-write. It
  reuses `assets/app.css`, `assets/ui.js`'s `esc()`, `vocab.js` (the event-type catalog
  drives its log form: same fields, spans get an end date, `combobox` degrades to plain
  text, `relatedContact` pickers are omitted), `dateUtils.js`, and `data/dropbox.js`.
- Its data layer is `assistantStore.js` with its **own Dexie database
  (`KennelOSAssistant`)** — never the main `KennelOSBreedingApp` db — holding exactly two
  tables: `dogs: 'id'` and `events: 'id, [subject_type+subject_id], event_date'`. Same
  conventions as the main schema (UUID ids, YYYY-MM-DD dates, filter-in-JS flags).
- Flows: **Get latest dogs** replaces the synced slice from the feed (dogs wholesale;
  events except locally-pending ones) and stamps `assistantLastSync`; **tap a dog → log
  event** creates a local event with `pending: 1`; **Send my updates** uploads all pending
  events as the outbox (rewritten wholesale each send). Only pending events can be
  deleted on the device — synced history is the owner's.
- The dog list is **grouped by litter** (header: nickname + "Sire × Dam" from the derived
  feed fields) with a **⚖ Weigh litter** button per group: one date + AM/PM, a lbs/oz row
  per pup, one save → one pending `weight_check` per weighed pup (blank rows skipped).
  Both this and single weigh-ins reproduce the main app's **weight-drop soft warning**:
  `assistantStore.js` mirrors `eventForm.js`'s total-ounce comparison and
  date→AM/PM→capture-time ordering (`getPriorWeighIn` scans synced + pending entries),
  and a decrease prompts a collected "Save anyway?" confirm, never a hard block. Keep the
  two implementations semantically in step if the main app's rule ever changes.
- **Acknowledgment loop**: after the owner imports the outbox and later pushes a fresh
  feed, the feed carries those same event ids back; the feed sync's `bulkPut` overwrites
  the pending copies, clearing the flag. Until then pending events keep riding every
  send, which is harmless (owner-side import is an idempotent upsert).
- The feed/outbox shapes carry `format_version` (`ASSISTANT_FORMAT_VERSION` /
  `ASSISTANT_OUTBOX_FORMAT_VERSION`, both 1) — bump only on an incompatible shape change.

### Maintenance notes

- Widening/narrowing what the helper sees = edit `ASSISTANT_DOG_FIELDS` or add an
  event-type filter in `buildAssistantFeed()` — one place, and update this section.
- All five new files (`assistant.html`, `assistant.js`, `data/dropbox.js`,
  `data/assistantSync.js`, `data/assistantStore.js`) are in the sw.js precache; the
  Dropbox API calls are cross-origin, so the service worker's cache-first handler ignores
  them (§12) — sync is always live network.
- No new tables, FKs, or `referenceRegistry.js` entries in the **main** schema: imported
  assistant events are ordinary Event rows, and the assistant db is a separate database
  on a separate device.

## 26.1 Documents & receipt attachments — local file storage

Real, **local** file storage, entirely offline — no external app, no Dropbox connection.
Two surfaces share one storage stack:

- **Documents** — a "Documents" page (`pages/documents.html` + `pages/documents.js`, in the
  **More** menu, plus a "📄 Documents" button on the dog page) where you file a document
  against a dog (pedigree / health test / registration / contract / other), grouped by dog,
  with a type filter and search. Full CRUD, all local.
- **Expense receipts** — the receipt-capture widget on both expense forms (§21): attach a
  receipt to any ledger row. See "Receipt capture" below.

**Storage stack (shared by both).** Two Dexie tables (§4, §5): `documents` (metadata + a
`dog_id` and a `file_id`, via `data/documentRepo.js` on the standard `makeRepo` +
`referenceRegistry` pattern) and `files` (the blob archive, via `data/fileRepo.js` — one row
per stored PDF: `blob` + `thumbnail` + meta). `expenses.receipt_file_id` points a ledger row
at a `files` row the same way. A file is **owned by exactly one** Document or Expense: it is
deleted alongside its owner in that repo's `hardDelete`, and so is *not* a
`referenceRegistry` entry (§7). `documents.dog_id` **is** guarded, via a `documents.dog_id`
line in `DOG_REFERENCES` — a dog with filed documents can't be hard-deleted out from under
them.

**Every stored file is a PDF.** An uploaded PDF is stored as-is. A photo/screenshot (camera,
or picked from the library — multi-page allowed for documents) is converted client-side to a
compressed multi-page PDF by `data/pdfBuild.js` — **no library**: it downscales + JPEG
re-encodes each page and embeds the JPEG directly via the PDF `DCTDecode` filter, and yields
a small JPEG data-URL thumbnail for the list. `createImageBitmap` also normalizes iPhone
HEIC on the way in. Viewing/downloading goes through the shared `viewPdfModal` (`assets/ui.js`)
/ the Documents page's own `<embed>` viewer, off a throwaway object URL.

**Receipt capture (`assets/receiptCapture.js`).** One shared widget — built the same way
`buildMileageFields`/`wireMileageMode` are shared — wired into **both** expense forms (the
Financials hub's Add Expense modal and each subject's Expense panel), so there's one
implementation. Take/choose a photo or screenshot, or upload a PDF. A freshly picked photo is
auto-scanned offline by `data/ocr.js` (vendored Tesseract.js, LSTM core; lazy — the ≈7 MB
engine loads only on first scan and every failure path degrades to manual entry) to pre-fill
amount / date / vendor / receipt # **only when those fields are still blank/default** — never
overwriting what the user typed. `resolveFileId()` at save time builds/stores the file (or
reuses/removes the existing one) and returns the `receipt_file_id` to persist.

**Durability.** `files.blob` is the schema's only binary field; it is base64-tagged through
the JSON backup and the Dropbox sync (`importExport.js`, `BACKUP_FORMAT_VERSION` 2 — see §5),
so filed documents and receipts survive backup/restore and two-phone sync. A plain
`JSON.stringify` would silently drop a Blob to `{}`, so any future Blob field must
round-trip the same way.

- **Precache:** `pages/documents.html`, `pages/documents.js`, `data/documentRepo.js`,
  `data/fileRepo.js`, `data/pdfBuild.js`, `data/ocr.js`, `assets/receiptCapture.js`, and the
  four `vendor/tesseract/*` assets are in `sw.js` — scanning works with no network after
  first install. Bump `CACHE_NAME` on any change to that file set (currently
  `kennelos-shell-v5`).
